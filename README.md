A literary science fiction novel about the impossibility of lossless transmission.

## Premise

Most science fiction assumes that when humanity encounters extraterrestrial intelligence, the challenge is to decode a single alien language or build a universal translator.

This novel rejects that assumption.

Humanity discovers that the cosmic background radiation—the hiss and static filtered out by every radio telescope—is actually a dense soup of alien transmissions. Countless sources. Overlapping. Ancient and recent. We've been bathed in it for decades and called it noise.

There is no single alien language. No unified "they." No canonical system to decode.

A xenolinguist named Tomasz Kowalski spends eight years decoding one signal. He succeeds. Then he applies his model to another signal, and it fails—cleanly, elegantly, catastrophically. The first wasn't a key to the cosmos. It was a private conversation.

The universe is not silent. It is cacophonous. And none of it translates.

## Structure

A memoir written in 2063 by a man who broke the Signal Translation Project twenty years earlier. Two temporal layers:

- **Present (2063):** Tom at 62, alone in Berkeley, writing instead of flying home to Kraków where his mother is dying.
- **Past (2043):** The year of the breakthrough, the failure, the collapse of his marriage, the unraveling of the project.

25 chapters. ~75,000 words.

## Themes

- The impossibility of lossless transmission
- The violence of compression—systems that require summaries, narratives, a coherent "they"
- The cost of seeing—insight as exile
- False understanding—the cruelty of being understood incorrectly
- The horror of plenitude—surrounded by meaning, none of it reachable
