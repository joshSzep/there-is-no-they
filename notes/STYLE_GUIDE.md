# Style Guide

## Narrative Frame

This novel is a **memoir** written by Tomasz Kowalski in **2063**, twenty years after the events of 2043.

He is known, by this point, as **the man who broke the Signal Translation Project**.

The book contains two temporal layers:

1. **The Present of Writing (2063):** Tom at 62, actively composing the memoir. What he's doing, thinking, and feeling *as he writes*.

2. **The Past Recounted (primarily 2043):** The events themselves—the breakthrough, the failure, the collapse of his marriage, the institutional fallout.

## Tense Structure

### Present-layer (2063): **Present tense**
Tom writing. Tom pausing. Tom looking out the window. Tom unable to finish a sentence.

> I write this in a room I did not expect to inhabit. The fog is coming in. I can see the bridge, or the ghost of it.

### Past-layer (2043): **Past tense**
The events as remembered and narrated.

> The model worked. I ran it again to be sure. It worked again. I allowed myself, for perhaps an hour, to feel something like triumph.

## Why This Frame Matters

### Distance and Presence
Twenty years gives Tom the distance to articulate what he couldn't say then—while the present-tense frame shows that articulation is *still* incomplete. He's still struggling with it. The memoir is not a victory lap. It's an attempt.

### The Reader Knows the Outcome
The frame tells us early: whatever Tom discovered, it came out. The project broke. He became infamous—or famous, or both. This removes false suspense about *whether* it will happen. The tension becomes *how* and *what it cost*.

### The Act of Writing as Theme
Tom's whole life was built on the belief that meaning could be extracted and transmitted. The memoir is his final test of that belief. Can he explain what happened? Can he make someone understand?

The present-layer should carry the weight of this question. Sometimes he will fail mid-sentence. Sometimes he will write something and then cross it out (figuratively—we see him abandon a line of thought). The act of writing is not neutral. It is the drama.

---

## Point of View

**First person**, Tom's voice throughout.

The past-layer is his memory, shaped by twenty years of reflection. He is not an unreliable narrator in the sense of deception—but memory is reconstruction, not playback. He knows this. He may say so.

The present-layer is immediate. Interior. We are in the room with him as he writes.

## Prose Texture

### General Principles
- Clean, precise sentences. Not ornate.
- Quiet. Restrained. Humane.
- Prefer concrete physical detail over abstraction.
- Prefer silence over cleverness.
- Short paragraphs. White space as punctuation.
- Let the weight accumulate through accretion, not declaration.

### Avoid
- Exposition dumps
- Philosophical lectures
- Explaining the themes explicitly
- Clever wordplay that calls attention to itself
- Dramatic exclamation
- Sentimentality

### Prefer
- Physical sensation: the body in the chair, the light through the window, the untouched coffee
- Small domestic details: Daniel's habit of humming, the sound of the house at night
- Pauses, hesitations, sentences that stop short
- The gap between what Tom wants to say and what he manages to say
- Implication over statement

---

## Dialogue

Spare. Realistic. Often incomplete.

People interrupt themselves. People trail off. People say things that don't quite land.

When Tomasz tries to explain what he's discovered, the dialogue should feel *effortful*—reaching for words that don't exist.

When Daniel responds, his words should be kind and reasonable and *slightly off*. Not wrong in a way that's his fault. Wrong in a way that reveals the gap.

---

## The Present-Layer: Specific Guidance

These sections should feel like someone **actually writing a memoir**. Not polished retrospective narration, but the act itself—hesitant, recursive, sometimes stuck.

Tom may:
- Start a paragraph and abandon it
- Reflect on why he's writing this now
- Struggle with what to include or exclude
- Address the reader directly (sparingly)
- Notice his present surroundings (the room, the light, his aging body)
- Think about Daniel, about what happened to their marriage, about now

The present-layer should be **shorter** than the past-layer—interruptions rather than extended scenes. But it should carry significant emotional weight.

---

## The Past-Layer: Specific Guidance

This is the bulk of the narrative. Told in past tense, but with the vividness of reconstructed memory.

Tom knows the ending. He's not building suspense. He's trying to render *what it was like*—to be in that room, to see the screen, to feel his mouth open and then close.

The pacing should be:
- Slow where it matters (the breakthrough, the failure, key conversations with Daniel)
- Compressed where it doesn't (institutional politics can be summarized, not dramatized in full)
- Attentive to sensory detail, especially in moments of emotional intensity

## The 2063 Context

**Tom's situation:**
- 62 years old. Still in Berkeley.
- Alone. He and Daniel are no longer together.
- His mother, Halina, is close to death in Kraków. This is why he's writing now.
- The Signal Translation Project collapsed years ago. Humanity moved on.
- Tom never moved on. He carries it still.

**Why now:**
Halina is dying. The woman who never said Daniel's name, who loved Tom from a careful distance, who raised him alone after his father drank himself to death—she's leaving.

Tom is writing because there's no one left to explain it to. Or because he owes it to someone. Or because he needs to see if the words work now, twenty years later.

The memoir is an act of grief before the grief has fully arrived.

**The world moved on:**
The project collapsed. The funding dried up. The signals are still there—still dense, still plural, still untranslatable—but humanity lost interest. There was no "they" to meet, no treaty to sign, no invasion to fear. The discovery that once rewrote everything became a footnote. A cautionary tale. A shrug.

Tom is the man who told the truth and watched it make no difference.

---

## The Voice of 62-Year-Old Tom

He is:
- Tired, but not defeated
- Wry, but not cynical
- Precise with language, because he still believes precision matters, even as he knows it's not enough
- Capable of tenderness, especially toward his past self and toward Daniel
- Not self-pitying—he takes responsibility for what happened, even the parts that weren't his fault
- Grieving—his mother, his marriage, the version of himself who believed in bridges

He is not:
- Bitter
- Grandiose
- Performing victimhood
- Pretending to have all the answers now

---

## Chapter Structure (Tentative)

Consider alternating:
- **Present-layer openings:** A few paragraphs of Tom in 2063, setting up what he's about to recount
- **Past-layer body:** The narrated events
- **Present-layer closings (optional):** Tom's reflection on what he just wrote, or his inability to reflect

This rhythm can vary. Some chapters may be entirely past-layer. Some present-layer sections may be longer when Tom is stuck or circling something difficult.

---

## The Title's Meaning

*There Is No They* operates on multiple levels:

1. **Literal:** The signals do not represent a unified alien civilization
2. **Epistemic:** There is no coherent "other" to decode, negotiate with, or fear
3. **Political:** The "they" that institutions need does not exist
4. **Personal:** Even in intimacy, there is no complete transmission—Daniel and Tom cannot fully reach each other
5. **Authorial:** The reader may realize, by the end, that even this memoir cannot deliver "them"—cannot deliver the truth of what Tomasz experienced

---

## What Success Looks Like

A reader finishes the novel and feels:
- The weight of what Tomasz discovered
- The impossibility of fully conveying it
- The quiet horror of plenitude
- The grief of a marriage that didn't fail through fault
- Something they cannot quite articulate

The novel should leave them with recognition *without a handle*. The experience of having understood something that slips away when they try to explain it to someone else.

This is the memoir's failure mode—and its success.
