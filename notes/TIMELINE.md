# Timeline

## Overview

This timeline anchors the chronology of the novel. Fixed dates provide consistency; approximate dates allow flexibility in drafting.

---

## Deep Past

### 2001
- **Tomasz Kowalski born** in Kraków, Poland

### 2005
- **Daniel born** in Fresno, California

### 2007
- **Daniel's parents killed** in a car accident. Daniel (age 2) raised by grandparents, then an aunt.

### ~2009-2012
- **Tom's father dies** of alcoholism-driven liver failure. Tom is approximately 8-11 years old. Halina raises him alone.

### 2010s-2020s
- **Tom's education.** Studies linguistics, acquires languages compulsively. Poland, then graduate work in Europe (Germany? UK?). Becomes fluent in 12 languages.
- **Daniel's education.** Undergrad somewhere in California. Comes to Berkeley for graduate school or early career. Studies something adjacent to science—policy, administration, communication.

## The Discovery Era

### 2032
- **The Chen Discovery.** Maya Chen, graduate student at UC Berkeley, makes her computational error. The cosmic background reveals structure. The world changes.
- Maya is ~32 years old.

### 2032-2033
- **Verification and acceptance.** The discovery is confirmed. Scientific community reorients. Media frenzy. Governments mobilize.

### 2033
- **Signal Translation Project founded** at UC Berkeley. Maya Chen becomes its public face. Initial funding floods in.
- **Tom moves to Berkeley** (age 32). Recruited for his linguistic expertise. Joins the new project. 
- **Tom meets Daniel.** Exact circumstances TBD, but likely through the university ecosystem. Daniel is 28, working in grant administration or a related field.

### 2033-2035
- **Tom and Daniel's relationship develops.** Dating, then committed partnership, then marriage.
- **Tom works on signal isolation and early translation attempts.** Learns the project, the data, the culture.

### 2035
- **Tom assigned to Pattern 7.** A promising candidate signal. He begins the eight-year project that will define his career.
- **Tom and Daniel marry** (approximate—could be 2034-2036). A small ceremony. Halina does not attend but sends a gift.

### 2035-2043
- **Eight years on Pattern 7.** Slow, grinding work. Incremental progress. Long periods of nothing. Tom's career stalls while Maya becomes famous.
- **The marriage settles into rhythm.** Good years. Not dramatic, just good. Daniel's patience, Tom's focus, the house they share.
- **Halina ages in Kraków.** Regular calls. She never says Daniel's name. The small, permanent gap.

## The Year of the Break: 2043

### Early 2043
- The project is eleven years old. Institutionalized. Calcified.
- Hundreds of patterns isolated. None definitively decoded.
- Political pressure mounting. Where are the results?
- Tom has been on Pattern 7 for eight years. He's close to something.

### Spring/Summer 2043 (approximate)
- **The Breakthrough.** Late at night. Alone. Tom's model achieves predictive validity on Pattern 7. It works.
- **The Hours After.** Tom checks his work. It holds. He allows himself to feel triumph.
- **The Clean Failure.** Tom applies the model to Pattern 12. Confident, structured, wrong. The premise collapses.
- **The Slack Jaw.** The moment of recognition. Silence.

### Following Weeks/Months
- **Tom tells no one.** Goes through the motions. Yusuf notices something wrong. Tom deflects.
- **Tom tries to tell Daniel.** The conversation fails. False understanding. The distance begins.
- **Institutional pressure builds.** Rachel wants a statement. David wants a report. Maya wants to announce.
- **Tom cannot deliver.** His explanations are heard as obstruction, breakdown, or sabotage.
- **The situation escalates.** Exactly how TBD—leak, confrontation, forced disclosure?

### Late 2043 / Early 2044
- **The truth emerges.** The project learns what Tom found—or a version of it.
- **Daniel leaves.** Not a fight. A recognition. He's been reaching and reaching. Tom can't reach back. The quiet departure.
- **The project begins to collapse.** Or begins to transform into something else. The premise is broken.

---

## The Collapse: 2044-2050 (approximate)

### 2044-2046
- **The project restructures.** Funding cuts. Staff departures. Maya's public statements become defensive.
- **Tom becomes "the man who broke the Signal Translation Project."** Famous or infamous, depending on who you ask.
- **Tom and Daniel divorce** (or simply separate permanently). The details TBD.

### 2046-2050
- **The project effectively ends.** Successor organizations are small, underfunded.
- **Maya steps down or is pushed out.** Her career continues but diminished. She writes a book. Gives fewer talks.
- **Public interest fades.** No "they" to meet. No story to tell. The signals become a footnote.

---

## The Quiet Years: 2050-2063

### 2050s
- **Tom's life after.** Mostly hiking. Long trails. The Pacific Crest. The Sierra. Days of walking alone, not talking.
- **He stays in Berkeley.** Doesn't return to Poland. Doesn't follow Daniel. Stays in the place where it happened.
- **He lives simply.** Savings, maybe some consulting, maybe a small pension from the project. Nothing that requires him to explain things to people.
- **Halina ages.** The calls continue. She still doesn't say Daniel's name—but now there's no Daniel to not mention.

### Early 2060s
- **Halina's health declines.** The calls become harder. She's forgetting things. She's in Kraków, alone or with caregivers.

---

## The Present: 2063

### The Memoir Year
- **Tom is 62.** Still in Berkeley. Alone.
- **Halina is dying.** Close to the end. In Kraków.
- **Tom begins writing.** The memoir. This book. He is writing *instead of going*.

### The Final Failure
- **Tom does not go to Kraków.** He writes instead. The memoir is avoidance, guilt, deflection—and also the only thing he knows how to do.
- **Halina dies in the final chapter.** Tom never makes it back in time to say goodbye.
- The man who could not bridge the cosmic gap cannot bridge the gap to his dying mother. He reaches for words instead of a plane ticket. The words don't arrive in time either.
