# Politics of 2043

## Overview

Eleven years after the Chen Discovery, humanity has not united. The knowledge that we are not alone became another surface onto which old fears, hopes, and conflicts were projected. The signals are a Rorschach test. Everyone sees what they need to see.

## Climate Reality

The crisis didn't end the world. It changed it.

- **Coastal adaptation:** Major cities are building, retreating, or drowning slowly. Miami is half-abandoned. New York has seawalls. The Netherlands is an engineering marvel. Bangladesh is a humanitarian catastrophe.
- **American geography:** The Southwest is largely depopulated—Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Tucson are shrinking husks. Climate migration reshaped the country. The Pacific Northwest and Great Lakes regions swelled.
- **The Bay Area:** Survived. Foggier now, cooler than the scorched interior. More expensive. More fortified. Berkeley remains a strange pocket of wealth and intellect perched on the edge of a changed continent.
- **Climate refugees:** A permanent political fact. Tens of millions displaced within the US alone. Hundreds of millions globally. The word "refugee" has lost its temporary connotation.

## Great Powers

**US-China:** The cold war of the 2020s thawed into something stranger—competitive cooperation. The discovery forced it. Neither could afford to let the other decode alone. Joint funding, shared data (officially), parallel espionage (obviously). The relationship is tense, transactional, and necessary.

**European Union:** Fractured in the 2030s under climate and migration pressure. Re-formed as a smaller, tighter Northern European Federation. Southern Europe is a patchwork of struggling states and regional compacts.

**Russia:** Contracted. Climate change made Siberia more habitable but couldn't reverse demographic and economic decline. Still nuclear, still dangerous, but no longer a primary actor.

**India:** Rose. The largest democracy, the largest population, a space program that rivals any. Demands a seat at every table and increasingly gets one.

**The Global South:** The old term feels inadequate. Some nations collapsed. Others leapfrogged. The map of power is more fractured and more fluid than any 20th-century model predicted.

## The Discovery's Political Impact

The Chen Discovery did not unite humanity. It gave everyone a new enemy, a new hope, or a new excuse—depending on who you asked.

### The Hopeful
- "We are not alone" became a secular gospel for internationalists, techno-optimists, and those desperate for transcendence.
- The signals were proof that intelligence could survive, could reach across space, could *mean something*.
- This hope fueled funding, cooperation, the Signal Translation Project itself.

### The Fearful
- For others, the signals were threat. Invasion. Contamination. The end of human specialness.
- Nationalist movements in the US, Europe, Brazil, and India built platforms on rejecting the "alien agenda."
- Some demanded the signals be suppressed. Others wanted weapons programs. A few called for preemptive strikes into empty space.

### The Indifferent
- Most people, most of the time, simply lived. The signals were background noise—literally and figuratively.
- You can't sustain existential awe for eleven years. Groceries still need buying. Rent still comes due.
- The discovery became another fact of life, like climate change: too big to hold, too present to ignore, too abstract to act on.

## Religion

The faiths did not collapse. They adapted.

- **Catholicism:** A new papal encyclical in 2035 declared that extraterrestrial intelligence, if it existed, would be part of God's creation. The Church has seen Copernicus before.
- **Evangelical Christianity:** Splintered. Some embraced the "angels or demons" framework. Others rejected the signals as hoax or satanic deception. The prosperity gospel crowd ignored it entirely.
- **Islam:** Varied by region and tradition. Some scholars found the signals compatible with Quranic cosmology. Others called for caution.
- **Buddhism:** Shrugged, mostly. Sentient beings are sentient beings.
- **New movements:** A dozen new religions emerged around the signals. Most are small. A few are troubling.

## The United States in 2043

**Political structure:** Still a republic. Barely. The 2030s tested every institution. Climate emergencies normalized executive power. Gerrymandering and voter suppression calcified into something close to permanent minority rule in many states. The coasts and cities are functionally a different country from the interior.

**The federal government:** Bloated, paralyzed, and still the largest funder of the Signal Translation Project. Congressional hearings demand progress. Senators who don't understand the science want answers they can repeat on camera.

**The military:** Wants to know if the signals are a threat. Funds classified parallel research. Probably has its own translation teams. Definitely has contingency plans no one discusses publicly.

**Public opinion:** Exhausted. Eleven years of "we might be close to a breakthrough" has eroded trust. The signals are either humanity's greatest discovery or the longest-running disappointment. Depends on the news cycle.

## Why the Demand for a "They" is Politically Existential

Every system that touches the signals needs them to *mean something deliverable*.

### Governments need:
- A threat assessment (is "they" hostile?)
- A diplomatic framework (can we negotiate with "they"?)
- A narrative for citizens (what does "they" want?)

### Media needs:
- A story with characters (who is "they"?)
- Conflict and resolution (what will "they" do?)
- Human-interest angles (how do we feel about "they"?)

### The public needs:
- Reassurance or righteous fear
- Something to believe in or against
- A "they" that can be imagined, discussed, voted on

### The Signal Translation Project needs:
- Continued funding (we're making progress toward understanding "they")
- Political protection (our work matters for national security / human survival)
- A reason to exist (there is a "they" to translate)

**The conclusion that there is no unified "they"—that the signals are irreducibly plural, local, untranslatable—is survivable for a philosopher.**

**It is not survivable for an institution, a government, or a species that organizes itself around shared narratives.**

## What Tomasz Threatens

If he's right, then:
- Eleven years of effort produced one local success and no generalizable method
- The premise of the entire project is false
- Billions of dollars were spent on a category error
- Every politician who championed "first contact" backed the wrong horse
- Every hopeful narrative was wishful thinking
- Every fearful narrative was shadow-boxing
- Humanity is surrounded by meaning it cannot access, voices it cannot understand, and there is no path forward

This cannot be announced. It can barely be thought.

And yet Tomasz knows it. And eventually, he will have to decide what to do with what he knows.
