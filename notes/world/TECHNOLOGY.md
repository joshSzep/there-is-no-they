# Technology

## Overview

The technology of 2043 and 2063 is advanced but not transformative. No singularity. No magic. The world changed gradually, unevenly, in ways that feel familiar.

The key principle: technology should recede into the background. It's the water the characters swim in, not the subject of the novel.

## 2043: The Year of the Break

### Computing and AI

**Artificial Intelligence:**
- AI is ubiquitous but not singular. No AGI, no superintelligence.
- Narrow AI handles most routine cognitive tasks: scheduling, research synthesis, translation (of human languages), data analysis.
- AI assistants are standard—like smartphones were in 2020. Everyone has one. No one thinks it's remarkable.
- The AI is good enough that its failures are more frustrating. It can translate French to English flawlessly, which makes the alien signals more maddening: if we can do *this*, why can't we do *that*?

**Machine Learning and Signal Analysis:**
- The Signal Translation Project uses cutting-edge ML systems—massive neural networks trained on the signal data.
- The ML can find patterns humans miss, but it cannot explain what those patterns mean.
- Tomasz's breakthrough was not an AI achievement. It was human insight—pattern recognition that required understanding, not just processing.
- This matters: the AI could have found the same correlations, but it wouldn't have known what it found. Tomasz knew. That's what made the failure devastating.

**Computing Infrastructure:**
- Quantum computing exists but is specialized—used for specific optimization problems, cryptography, simulation.
- Most computing is still classical, just faster, more distributed, more efficient.
- Cloud computing has become background infrastructure, like electricity. No one thinks about where the compute comes from.

### Communication

**Networks:**
- Global high-bandwidth connectivity is standard. Lag is minimal. Video calls are seamless.
- The "internet" has fragmented into regional networks with imperfect interoperability—US, EU, China, India, others. A Cold War relic.
- Encryption is ubiquitous. Privacy is a constant negotiation.

**Devices:**
- Smartphones evolved into something smaller, more integrated. Worn, not carried. Glasses, earpieces, implants for early adopters.
- Screens are everywhere and nowhere—projected, embedded, AR-overlaid.
- Tom probably still uses something like a laptop for focused work. Researchers are conservative.

### Transportation

**Ground:**
- Electric vehicles are standard. Gasoline is expensive and stigmatized.
- Autonomous vehicles are common in cities. Manual driving still exists but is becoming a specialty skill.
- High-speed rail connects major corridors in the US (finally). Flying is for longer distances.

**Air:**
- Electric short-haul flights are emerging. Long-haul still uses (cleaner) jet fuel.
- Air travel is more expensive than in 2020—carbon pricing. The casual flight to Vegas is less common.

**Space:**
- Commercial space industry is mature. Orbital stations, lunar outposts (small, scientific).
- No Mars colony. Lots of announcements, repeated delays. Maybe a crewed mission has happened, maybe not.
- Space telescopes and deep-space probes are the primary tools for signal observation. No travel to signal sources—they're thousands of light-years away.

### Medicine and Biology

**Healthcare:**
- Gene therapy is routine for some conditions. Personalized medicine based on genetic profiles.
- Cancer is manageable, often curable. Heart disease and dementia remain challenges.
- Life expectancy in wealthy countries has crept up—mid-80s average. The gains are unequally distributed.

**Biotech:**
- Synthetic biology is advancing. Lab-grown meat is common. Biofuels are one piece of the energy puzzle.
- No radical life extension. No uploading. No transhumanist transformation.

### Energy and Climate

**Energy:**
- Renewables dominate electricity generation in most developed countries. Solar, wind, advanced nuclear.
- Fossil fuels are declining but not gone. The transition is messy, contested, incomplete.
- Energy is generally abundant in wealthy regions. Less so elsewhere.

**Climate:**
- The crisis is ongoing. 1.8-2.2°C above pre-industrial by 2043.
- Extreme weather is normal. Adaptation is constant. Some regions are abandoning, others fortifying.
- The Bay Area: foggier, milder than the scorched interior, expensive, crowded with climate migrants.

## 2063: Twenty Years Later

### What Changed

**AI:**
- More capable, more integrated, more invisible.
- AI handles most knowledge work that doesn't require genuine creativity or judgment.
- Employment has restructured around this. Many people don't "work" in the traditional sense. Universal basic income or equivalent in most developed countries.
- Still no AGI. The goalposts kept moving. "True AI" remains five years away, as it has for decades.

**Computing:**
- Quantum computing is mainstream for specialized applications.
- Classical computing has hit physical limits but continues to improve through architecture and efficiency.
- Personal devices are even more integrated—subcutaneous for many, though Tom probably resists this.

**Communication:**
- Near-total connectivity for those who want it.
- "Disconnection" is a luxury, a choice, sometimes a pathology.
- Regional network fragmentation has deepened. The US and China networks barely interoperate.

**Transportation:**
- Autonomous vehicles are the default. Manual driving requires a special license.
- Short-haul electric flight is standard. Long-haul still uses fuel (advanced biofuels, synthetic fuels).
- Hyperloop or equivalent connects some corridors. Travel is fast, expensive, less common than in 2020.

**Space:**
- Permanent lunar presence. Small but real.
- Mars mission happened (crewed, scientific, not a colony). International, controversial, celebrated then forgotten.
- No interstellar capability. The signals remain unreachable.

**Medicine:**
- Gene editing has eliminated many inherited conditions. Ethical debates continue.
- Lifespan in wealthy countries: average low-90s. Tom at 62 is middle-aged.
- Dementia is treatable. Cancer is mostly solved. New diseases have emerged.

**Climate:**
- 2.5-3°C above pre-industrial. The worst scenarios were avoided; the moderate scenarios arrived.
- Coastal cities are reshaped. Miami is largely abandoned. Manhattan has seawalls.
- The Southwest US is sparsely populated. The Great Lakes region is crowded.
- Climate adaptation is a permanent, expensive, exhausting project.

**The Signals:**
- Still there. Still dense. Still plural.
- Research continues at low levels—a few universities, some private efforts.
- The Signal Translation Project collapsed in the late 2040s. Its successor organizations are small, underfunded, ignored.
- The public has moved on. "The signals" are a cultural reference, not a living obsession.
- Some people still listen. Most people don't care.

## Technology at the Project (2043)

### What Tomasz Uses

**Workstation:**
- High-performance computing access for modeling and analysis.
- Visualization tools: spectrograms, waveform displays, structural diagrams, 3D pattern maps.
- Custom software built over years—layers of code, some elegant, some held together with duct tape.

**Data:**
- Access to petabytes of signal recordings.
- Indexed, searchable, annotated by eleven years of researchers.
- Pattern 7's data is intimately familiar—Tom has spent eight years with it.

**Collaboration:**
- Shared workspaces with his team. Real-time document editing, asynchronous annotation.
- The work is solitary at the edges—the insight happens alone—but supported by infrastructure.

**The Night of the Breakthrough:**
- Late. The building quiet. The hum of ventilation.
- A screen showing output. Numbers, structures, predictions.
- Tom alone with the machine and the data and the knowledge that it worked.

### What the Technology Cannot Do

- Translate meaning. The AI can find patterns; it cannot understand them.
- Bridge the gap. No tool delivers understanding directly from one mind to another.
- Save the project. Technology serves the premise; it cannot rescue a false premise.

## Constraints for the Novel

Technology should:
- Feel real and grounded, not speculative or distracting
- Serve the story without becoming the subject
- Be present in small details (Tom's devices, the workstation, the visualizations)
- Highlight by contrast: AI can translate human languages, but not this. That's the wound.

Technology should NOT:
- Offer solutions
- Be explained at length
- Become a character
- Distract from the human story
