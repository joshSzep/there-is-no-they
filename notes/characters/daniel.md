# Daniel

## Basics

- **Name:** Daniel (Danny to friends, Dan never)
- **Age:** 38
- **Origin:** Inland California—Fresno, maybe. Not Bay Area native.
- **Current Location:** Berkeley, California
- **Profession:** Grant administration, adjacent to the translation project. Near the work without being consumed by it.

## Background

- Orphaned at age 2. Parents killed in a car accident.
- Raised by extended family—grandparents, then an aunt. Loved, but patchwork.
- Learned early that family is what you build, not just what you're given.

---

## Personality

- Warm where Tomasz is reserved.
- Social where Tomasz is solitary.
- Remembers birthdays, keeps up with friends, makes sure they don't become hermits.
- But not shallow. Can sit with Tomasz in silence and not need to fill it.
- Learned early that Tomasz's quiet isn't absence—it's presence without performance.

## The Marriage

- Met Tomasz when Tom moved to Berkeley a decade ago.
- They were a perfect fit. Yin to his yang.
- Tomasz cooks; Daniel cleans up and puts on music.
- Daniel talks through his day; Tomasz listens, asks one precise question that cracks something open.
- They read in the same room, not speaking, and it's enough.
- Daniel learned a few words of Polish—badly, charmingly. Halina likes him despite herself.
- Not dramatic. Just *good*. The kind of marriage that works because both people keep choosing it.

## After the Discovery

Daniel sees Tomasz come home different. Doesn't know from what—only that something happened.

At first he assumes work stress. A grant rejection. A difficult colleague. He gives space. Makes dinner. Waits.

But the distance doesn't close. Tomasz is present but *not there*. Answers questions but the answers are hollow. Touches Daniel's shoulder in passing but his hand feels like it's reaching across something vast.

Daniel asks: "What's wrong?"

Tomasz tries to explain.

And Daniel *understands*. Or thinks he does. He says the right things. Supportive things.

- "That sounds overwhelming."
- "You'll figure it out."
- "Maybe you need to talk to someone."

All reasonable. All loving. All wrong.

## The Tragedy

They were complementary because they *could reach each other*. Different enough to be interesting, aligned enough to meet in the middle.

Now there's no middle. Tomasz has seen something that can't be handed across the breakfast table. And Daniel—good, patient, loving Daniel—keeps reaching for a version of Tomasz that no longer exists.

He's not failing. He's doing everything right.

That's what makes it unbearable.

## Critical Constraint

Daniel must not become a foil or obstacle. He is loving and acting in good faith. The failure is not his fault. The tragedy is structural, not personal.
