## The Small, Permanent Gap

The distance between Halina and Tomasz is not dramatic. He didn't flee Poland. She didn't disown him.

But there's a reason he lives in Berkeley and not Kraków. A reason the calls are regular but brief. A reason she speaks around his marriage rather than about it.

She likes Daniel, despite herself. He learned a few words of Polish—badly, charmingly. She corrects his pronunciation with something that might be affection.

But she doesn't say his name. And Tomasz notices.

## What She Represents

Tomasz already knew what it meant to carry a self that doesn't fully translate. To be legible to some people and not to others.

His mother loves him. His mother does not fully see him.

This is not unusual. This is not tragedy. This is just family.

But it rhymes with what comes later—the cosmic loneliness, the impossibility of full transmission. The knowledge that even love does not guarantee understanding.

## Role in Story

Minor but resonant. A touchstone for the smaller, older version of the wound the novel explores. The gap that is survivable, that Tomasz has learned to live with—before he encounters the gap that is not.
