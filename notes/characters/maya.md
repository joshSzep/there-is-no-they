## Then: The Graduate Student (2032, eleven years ago)

- UC Berkeley, signal processing
- Dissertation was mundane—interference patterns, noise reduction, algorithm optimization
- Made an error. Forgot to apply a filter. Ran the wrong version of her code.
- Looked at the output and saw *structure* where there should have been static.
- Almost deleted it. Almost assumed she'd broken something.
- But she was curious. Or procrastinating. Or tired enough to look closer.
- Showed her advisor. He didn't understand either. They ran it again. And again.

The story she tells now is cleaner than it was. In the telling, she "had an intuition." In reality, she was confused and a little scared and didn't sleep for three days.

She wasn't brilliant. She was lucky. And then she was smart enough to make the most of it.

## Now: The Rockstar

- TED talks. Popular science books. "The Woman Who Heard the Universe."
- Photogenic. Charismatic. Genuinely good at explaining things to non-specialists.
- The face of the translation project, even though she's not the one doing the translation work anymore.
- Management now. Fundraising. Congressional testimony. Documentary interviews.
- Worked twice as hard to be taken half as seriously—until the discovery made her undeniable.

---

## Personality

- Warm in public. Efficient in private.
- Good at reading rooms, adjusting her register for senators vs. scientists vs. journalists.
- Genuinely believes in the work. Genuinely believes in herself. These have become hard to separate.
- Not arrogant, but confident. The kind of confidence that comes from having been proven right once, spectacularly.

## The Complexity

She's not a fraud. She really did make the discovery. She really is smart.

But she's built an empire on a premise: that the signals are *related*. That there's a unified "them" to decode. That her discovery was the first step toward contact.

She needs there to be a "they." Her career, her identity, her legacy—all of it depends on the signals being puzzle pieces, not unrelated shards.

She's not lying. She believes it. She *has* to believe it.

## Relationship to Tomasz

- She hired him. Or approved his hiring. He's one of "her" people.
- She respects him. Probably doesn't think about him much.
- He's reliable. Careful. Publishes good work. Doesn't cause problems.
- The quiet ones who do the actual work while she does the talking.

When his breakthrough happens, she'll want to announce it. Press conference. Paper in Nature. The next step in *her* story.

And then he'll have to tell her what he actually found.

---

## The Danger She Represents

She's not a villain. She's a system.

She's what happens when discovery gets institutionalized, funded, narrativized. She's the pressure that demands a "they."

She's sympathetic. She was a bumbling grad student once. She got lucky. She made the most of it. Who wouldn't?

But she cannot let the premise collapse. Too much depends on it—funding, careers, her legacy, humanity's hope. She will resist what Tomasz knows, not out of malice, but because the alternative is unthinkable.

---

## Role in Story

The institutional pressure personified. The person who will demand Tomasz explain, summarize, deliver a "they." The person who will not understand why he can't—or won't believe him when he tries to explain.

Not an antagonist. A tragedy in parallel. Someone who built her life on a beautiful error.
