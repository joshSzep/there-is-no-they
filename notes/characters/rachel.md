# Rachel Stern

## Basics

- **Name:** Rachel Stern
- **Age:** 39 (in 2043)
- **Origin:** Chicago. East Coast education, West Coast career.
- **Position:** Director of Communications, Signal Translation Project

---

## Background

- BA in journalism, MA in science communication
- Worked at NASA public affairs before the project recruited her in 2036
- Good at her job. Very good. That's the problem.
- Single, focused, lives for the work. The project is her identity as much as it is Maya's.

---

## Personality

- Sharp, fast, precise. She thinks in headlines and soundbites.
- Not cynical—she genuinely believes in the mission. She thinks communication is *how* the mission succeeds.
- Impatient with researchers who can't explain their work simply. "If you can't say it in two sentences, you don't understand it."
- This is a reasonable belief for human knowledge. It is catastrophically wrong for what Tom has discovered.

---

## Her Job

Rachel's job is to make the project legible to the world:
- Press releases that convey progress without overpromising
- Congressional testimony prep that keeps funding flowing
- Documentary coordination that makes the science feel human
- Crisis management when things go wrong

She is the interface between the researchers' complexity and the public's need for narrative.

She is, in structural terms, the violence of compression personified.

---

## Relationship to Tom

She barely knows him. He's one of dozens of researchers—quiet, competent, not her problem.

Until the breakthrough.

When Tom's decode succeeds, Rachel sees the story: "First Translation of Alien Signal." She starts drafting. She imagines the press conference, the Nature cover, the documentary segment.

She asks Tom for a summary. Two paragraphs. What does it mean? What did we learn?

Tom cannot answer.

---

## The Conflict

Rachel needs a story. Tom has an anti-story.

She pushes: "Just give me something. We'll refine it together."
Tom tries to explain why there's nothing to give.
She hears: "Difficult scientist being difficult."

She's not wrong that scientists are sometimes precious about their work. She's not wrong that communication requires simplification.

She's wrong about *this*.

---

## What Rachel Represents

The good-faith demand that cannot be met. The reasonable expectation that is, in this case, impossible.

Rachel is not a villain. She's a professional doing professional work. The system she serves—the need for narrative, the requirement that meaning be portable—is the antagonist. She's just its voice.

---

## Role in Story

- Appears after the breakthrough, pushing for a public statement
- Grows frustrated with Tom's inability to summarize
- May escalate to Maya or the deputy director
- Represents the institutional pressure that doesn't understand silence
- Her confusion is genuine: why won't he just *explain*?
