## Personality

- Quiet. Not shy—quiet. Comfortable with silence.
- Colleagues sometimes forget he's in the room until he speaks, and then they listen.
- Patient, attentive. Listens like words matter.
- Doesn't publish much, but what he publishes is careful. Respected. Cited.
- Tender in private, reserved in public.

---

## Physical Life

- Runs in the mornings. Not fast. The rhythm helps him think.
- Cooks simple food.
- Touches Daniel's shoulder in passing, not for show, just because.

---

## Background

- Gay. Married to Daniel.
- Father died of alcoholism-driven liver failure when Tom was a child. Grew up with Halina alone.
- Left Poland—not dramatically, didn't flee. But there's a reason he's in Berkeley and not Kraków.
- Moved to Berkeley a decade ago to pursue the translation project.
- No children. A choice they made together, or a choice that made itself.

## The Wound Beneath the Wound

He has spent his entire adult life believing that *if he just worked hard enough*, he could reach anyone. That connection was effort. That understanding was labor.

Twelve languages—and they trained him for exactly this failure. He knew translation was loss. That idiom doesn't port. That meaning is contextual.

He *knew* this professionally. But he still believed in the project. Still believed the gap could be bridged with enough care, rigor, patience.

He was wrong about scale, not principle.

Human plurality was hard. Alien plurality is **impossible**.

---

## The Specific Loneliness

He already knew what it meant to be legible to some people and not to others. To code-switch. To carry a self that doesn't fully translate.

The cosmic revelation rhymes with something he's always known—but at a scale that dwarfs it.

---

## Role in Story

The primary point of view. The man who decodes one alien transmission, applies it to another, and watches it fail cleanly. The slack jaw. The man who cannot explain what he knows without the explanation being wrong.

## Twenty Years Later (2063)

- **Age:** 62
- **Location:** Still Berkeley
- **Marital status:** Alone. He and Daniel are no longer together.
- **Profession:** Unknown / retired / peripheral

**Known as:** "The man who broke the Signal Translation Project."

The project collapsed. Funding dried up. Humanity moved on—lost interest when there was no "they" to meet, no story to tell. The signals are still there, still dense, still plural. Nobody cares anymore.

Tom never moved on. He carries it.

**Why he's writing now:**
Halina is dying. His mother, in Kraków, who never said Daniel's name, who raised him alone, who loved him from a careful distance—she's close to death.

He's writing because there's no one left to tell. Because she's leaving and he never explained it to her. Because the words might work now, twenty years later. Because they might not.

The memoir is grief before the grief has fully arrived.
