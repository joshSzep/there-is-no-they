# David Levy

## Basics

- **Name:** David Levy
- **Age:** 58 (in 2043)
- **Origin:** New York. The kind of New Yorker who never quite leaves, even in California.
- **Position:** Deputy Director for Research, Signal Translation Project

---

## Background

- PhD in astrophysics, Princeton. Post-doc at JPL.
- Never made a major discovery. Became an administrator instead.
- Joined the project in 2035 as a division head. Promoted to deputy director in 2039.
- Has managed researchers for twenty years. Knows how to get results. Knows how to handle egos.

---

## Personality

- Pragmatic. Political in the institutional sense—reads rooms, manages up and down.
- Not a scientist anymore, not really. A manager who remembers being a scientist.
- Gruff but fair. Researchers respect him without liking him.
- Believes in the project, but his belief is instrumental: the project is important, therefore it must continue, therefore it must show progress.

---

## His Job

David is the filter between researchers and leadership:
- Reviews research reports before they reach Maya
- Allocates resources, assigns personnel, mediates disputes
- Translates scientific findings into administrative language
- Protects researchers from political pressure (when he can)
- Protects the institution from researchers (when he must)

He is middle management. He is the membrane.

## Relationship to Tom

David knows Tom as a name on org charts and a line in budget spreadsheets. Reliable. Productive. No complaints.

When the breakthrough happens, David sees it as vindication: finally, progress. The kind of result that justifies budgets, satisfies funders, and shuts up the critics.

He asks Tom for a report. Standard form. Findings, methodology, implications.

Tom submits something. It's technically accurate and completely useless.

David asks for clarification. Tom provides clarification that clarifies nothing.

David starts to suspect something is wrong—not with the science, but with Tom. Is he burned out? Having a breakdown? Protecting something?

---

## The Conflict

David needs deliverables. Tom has discovered that the deliverable the project was built to produce does not exist.

David tries to help: "Just tell me what you found. I'll handle the framing."
Tom tries to explain.
David hears: "There's a problem with the results."
Tom means: "There's a problem with the premise."

David cannot hear that. The premise is not his department. The premise is above his pay grade. The premise is the foundation.

## What David Represents

The bureaucratic layer that filters reality. Not malicious—functional. The system needs reports, summaries, progress. David provides the interface.

He is the reason the truth cannot travel upward without being transformed.

---

## His Tragedy

David is a scientist who became an administrator because administration was what he was good at. He gave up discovery for management. He made peace with that.

Now he's managing the collapse of something he helped build, and he doesn't have the framework to understand why it's collapsing.

In another life, he might have been the one in Tom's chair. He might have understood.

## Role in Story

- Appears as the bureaucratic pressure point between Tom and Maya
- Asks for reports Tom cannot write
- Grows suspicious, then frustrated, then alarmed
- May try to protect Tom (misreading the situation) or expose him (reading it correctly but wrongly)
- Represents the institutional layer that processes truth into narrative
