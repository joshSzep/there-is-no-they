## Relationship to Tom

They are not close friends—Tom doesn't have close friends at work—but they are *familiar*. Eight years of adjacent desks, shared coffee, nodding at each other's insights.

Yusuf respects Tom's precision. Tom respects Yusuf's steadiness.

They have developed a rhythm. Yusuf talks about his kids; Tom listens. Tom shares a small observation about the data; Yusuf considers it seriously.

It's not intimacy. It's the next best thing: professional companionship.

## After the Failure

Yusuf is the first to notice something wrong.

Not the content—Tom doesn't tell him—but the *absence*. Tom stops coming to the shared workspace. Tom stops responding to messages. Tom's face, when Yusuf sees him in the hallway, is closed in a way it never was.

Yusuf asks: "Everything okay?"

Tom says: "Fine. Just working through something."

Yusuf doesn't push. He assumes it's personal—stress, health, something with Daniel. He gives Tom space.

This is kindness. It is also failure.

## What Yusuf Represents

The colleague who does everything right and still can't help. The limits of professional solidarity. The way even decent people fail each other when the gap is too wide.

He is not a foil. He is not obtuse. He simply doesn't have the information, and even if he did, he might not have the framework to hold it.

## Role in Story

- Present in early chapters as part of the workspace texture
- Notices Tom's withdrawal but misinterprets it
- May appear in the institutional pressure scenes—someone Tom has to lie to by omission
- A face in the crowd when the project collapses, still not fully understanding what happened
