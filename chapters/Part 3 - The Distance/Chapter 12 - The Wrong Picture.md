# Chapter 12: The Wrong Picture

Daniel tried to help.

That's what made it unbearable—not indifference, not conflict, but help. Active, loving, well-intentioned help, based on a picture that was wrong.

He bought me books.

I came home one evening, maybe a week after the failed conversation, and found a stack of them on the kitchen table. He had wrapped them in brown paper, the way he always did with gifts, with a small card on top: *For when you're ready. Love, D.*

I unwrapped them slowly, one by one. A book on the history of SETI. A philosophical treatise on alien intelligence and the limits of comprehension. A memoir by a physicist who had wrestled with questions of meaning and knowledge. A slim volume of poetry—Mary Oliver, our shared favorite—with a ribbon marking a poem about mystery.

He had chosen them carefully. I could see the thought behind each one: *This might help. This might give him words for whatever he's struggling with. This might bridge the gap.*

I sat at the kitchen table and looked at the books, and I felt something collapse inside me.

It's been three days since I called Ewa. I told her I was booking a flight. She was relieved—I could hear it in her voice, the tension releasing. "Good," she said. "Good, Tom. She'll be so glad."

I still haven't booked the flight.

The airline website is open in another tab. I keep going back to it, looking at the options, the departure times, the seat maps. Warsaw, then Kraków. Sixteen hours. I could be there by tomorrow night.

But every time I'm about to click "Book," something stops me. My hand hovers over the trackpad and won't move.

I think I'm afraid of what will happen when I arrive. Of standing at my mother's bedside with nothing to say. Of the wrong picture she has of me—the successful scientist, the man who decoded alien signals, the son who chose his career over his family—and how that picture will remain wrong even as she dies.

So I write about Daniel's books instead. Because that's a failure I've already survived.

---

Let me tell you about the help.

Over the following weeks, Daniel developed a theory. He didn't call it that—he was too careful, too respectful of my expertise—but I could see him constructing it, piece by piece, based on his understanding of what I'd told him.

His theory went something like this: I had made a discovery that challenged my assumptions about the project. The discovery was intellectually difficult and emotionally destabilizing. I needed time to process it, to integrate it into my worldview, to find a new framework that could accommodate what I'd learned.

This was a reasonable theory. It fit the facts as he understood them. And it led to reasonable interventions.

The books were one intervention. Time was another—he gave me space, didn't press, waited for me to be ready. Gentleness was a third—he was careful with me in those weeks, solicitous, treating me like someone recovering from an illness.

All of it was kind. All of it was wrong.

Because my problem wasn't processing. It wasn't that I needed time to integrate new information into an existing framework. It was that the framework itself had collapsed—not just mine, but all frameworks everywhere, all attempts to comprehend the signals through language and theory.

Daniel's help was like offering a ladder to someone who had just discovered there was no ground. The ladder was perfectly good. It just had nothing to stand on.

---

One night, he suggested therapy.

We were in bed, both of us reading—or pretending to read. I was staring at the same page I'd been staring at for twenty minutes. Daniel closed his book and turned to me.

"I've been thinking," he said. "Maybe it would help to talk to someone. A professional."

He said it gently, without pressure. An offer, not a demand.

"Someone who specializes in... I don't know. Scientists dealing with paradigm shifts. Career transitions. That kind of thing."

I put down my book. I looked at him.

"You think I need therapy."

"I think you're struggling. And I want to help, but I feel like I'm not... reaching you. Maybe someone trained for this could."

It was such a reasonable suggestion. Such a loving suggestion. And it made me want to scream.

Because what would I tell a therapist? That I'd discovered alien languages were mutually incomprehensible? That I'd proved the universe was lonelier than we thought? That I couldn't explain this to anyone, including my husband, because the thing itself resisted explanation?

The therapist would nod. The therapist would ask careful questions. The therapist would build a picture, just like Daniel had built a picture, and the picture would be wrong.

I would pay someone to misunderstand me professionally.

"Maybe," I said. "I'll think about it."

Daniel nodded. He didn't push. He reached out and squeezed my hand—that gesture again, the one that broke my heart—and then he picked up his book and went back to reading.

I lay there in the dark, feeling the warmth of his body beside me, feeling more alone than I had ever felt in my life.

---

I want to be clear about something.

Daniel was not the villain of this story. There are no villains. There is only the gap—the distance between minds, the failure of transmission, the loneliness that comes from seeing something others cannot see.

Daniel did everything right. He listened. He gave space. He offered help. He loved me, consistently and genuinely, throughout the entire slow collapse of our marriage.

The problem wasn't his actions. The problem was that no actions could fix what was broken. The gap wasn't a misunderstanding to be resolved; it was a structural feature of reality. No amount of patience, no amount of kindness, no amount of professional intervention could bridge it.

This is what I couldn't tell him. This is what I still can't explain.

The gap is real. It exists between all minds, all the time. We paper over it with language, with shared assumptions, with the comfortable fiction of mutual understanding. But the paper is thin, and once you see through it, you cannot unsee.

Daniel saw a husband in crisis. He saw someone struggling with a professional setback, needing support and time.

I saw the end of everything I had believed about communication, about connection, about the possibility of reaching another mind.

We were looking at different worlds. And we didn't know it.

---

The fog is thick again today. I can hear foghorns in the distance—the low, mournful sound that has become the soundtrack of my California life. When I first moved here, I found the foghorns romantic. Now they just sound like what they are: warnings. Signals into the void, hoping for response.

I should book the flight. I should go.

Instead, I'm writing about the months after my failed attempt to explain. The months when Daniel's help became a wall, when his kindness became a prison.

That's not fair. I know it's not fair. He wasn't trying to wall me in or imprison me. He was trying to love me, in the only ways he knew how.

But love built on a wrong picture is still a cage.

---

Let me tell you about the small moments.

There was the night he made my favorite meal—pierogi, laboriously hand-made, because he knew I missed Polish food. He set the table with candles, opened a bottle of wine, presented the dumplings with a flourish. "I know things have been hard," he said. "I thought this might help."

I ate the pierogi. They were good—not as good as my mother's, but good. I smiled and thanked him and pretended the gesture had reached me.

But all I could think was: he thinks this is about homesickness. He thinks I'm missing something familiar, something from the past. He doesn't understand that the past itself has become unrecognizable, that home is no longer a place I can return to.

There was the evening he suggested a vacation. "We could go somewhere," he said. "Get away from the lab, from Berkeley, from all of this. Just the two of us."

I imagined it: a beach somewhere, or a cabin in the mountains. The two of us alone, without the distractions of work. He thought it would bring us closer. He thought that what I needed was rest, perspective, quality time.

But the gap would come with us. The gap was inside me now. There was no vacation from the shape of my own mind.

There was the morning he found me crying in the kitchen. Not sobbing—just tears, running down my face while I made coffee, as if someone had left a faucet on. He held me without asking why. He said: "Whatever it is, we'll get through it together."

And I wanted so badly to believe him. I wanted to believe that "together" was possible, that the word meant what it used to mean.

But I knew it didn't. Together required a bridge, and the bridge was gone.

---

The worst part was seeing myself through his eyes.

Daniel kept a kind of running narrative about me—not malicious, not even conscious, just the story that spouses tell themselves about each other. In his narrative, I was: brilliant but troubled, going through a hard time, in need of patience and support.

This narrative was generous. It made me sympathetic. It positioned him as the helper, the steady one, the rock.

And it was wrong. Not in its facts but in its frame. Daniel saw my withdrawal as a symptom—something to be treated, managed, eventually cured. He didn't see it as a response to something real, something structural, something that couldn't be cured because it wasn't a disease.

I started to see myself through his eyes. I started to wonder if maybe he was right. Maybe I was having some kind of breakdown. Maybe the insight was a delusion, a symptom of stress or overwork. Maybe I just needed to rest, to talk to someone, to let the loving husband and the skilled therapist put me back together.

This was the most insidious part. The wrong picture became a mirror. I looked into Daniel's eyes and saw a man who needed help, and I started to believe that man was me.

---

I'm going to pause here and acknowledge something.

My mother's picture of me is also wrong. Has always been wrong.

She sees a son who left. Who chose America over Poland, career over family, English over Polish. Who visits rarely and calls infrequently and has always been more interested in the stars than in the people right in front of him.

This picture is not entirely inaccurate. The facts are mostly true. But the frame is wrong, just as Daniel's frame was wrong. She sees my distance as a choice, a rejection, a judgment on her life and her country and her language.

She doesn't see that the distance was there before I left. That I was always falling into the gap, always feeling the loneliness of minds that can't quite touch. That I went to America not to escape her but to escape the weight of a connection I couldn't sustain.

When I go to Kraków—if I go to Kraków—I will stand at her bedside and she will look at me through her wrong picture, and I will look at her through mine, and the gap will be there between us, and she will die with the gap unbridged.

This is what I'm afraid of. This is why I haven't booked the flight.

Not the death. The distance.

---

Let me finish the chapter.

Daniel's picture of me hardened over the following months. Not because he stopped loving me—he never stopped loving me—but because pictures, once formed, are hard to change. Every new piece of information got incorporated into the existing frame. Every confusing behavior got explained by the existing narrative.

If I was distant, it was because I was still processing.

If I was irritable, it was because I was stressed.

If I couldn't explain what was wrong, it was because I wasn't ready yet.

The frame absorbed everything. It was flexible, accommodating, resilient. And it was completely wrong.

I tried, occasionally, to correct it. I would start conversations—"Daniel, it's not that I'm struggling with a professional setback"—but I never knew where to go from there. What was it, if not that? I didn't have words for the alternative.

So the conversations would trail off, and Daniel would nod sympathetically, and the frame would remain intact, and we would go back to our parallel lives, side by side but not together.

---

The sun is setting. I've written all day, and I'm still in this garage, and my mother is still dying in Kraków.

Tomorrow, I tell myself. Tomorrow I'll book the flight.

But I've said that before. I've said it for twenty years, about various things. Tomorrow I'll talk to Daniel. Tomorrow I'll tell Maya the truth. Tomorrow I'll call my mother and really talk, really explain who I am and why I've been so far away.

Tomorrow never comes. Tomorrow is a word we use to postpone the unbearable.

---

Daniel's wrong picture stayed with us until the end.

Three years later, when we finally separated, he still thought he understood what had happened. "You changed," he said. "After that night in the lab, you changed, and I couldn't reach you anymore."

He was right about that. I had changed. But he was wrong about why, wrong about how, wrong about what reaching would have required.

"I'm sorry," I said. "I'm so sorry."

"I know you are," he said. "I know you didn't mean to shut me out."

But I hadn't shut him out. That's what I wanted to scream, what I still want to scream across the years and the distance. I hadn't built a wall. I had seen through one—the wall of language, of assumed understanding, of the comfortable fiction that minds can truly meet.

And once you see through the wall, you can't unsee it. You stand in the openness, the terrible openness, and there's nothing to hold on to.

Daniel thought I was inside a fortress. I was lost in a void.

The difference is everything. The difference is a lifetime of being misunderstood by someone who loved you completely.

---

Tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll book the flight.

But tonight, I sit with Daniel's wrong picture. I sit with all the books he bought me, all the meals he cooked, all the gentle patience that couldn't save us.

I loved him. I still love him, if love is the right word for what remains after everything else is gone.

But love wasn't enough. The picture was wrong, and the gap was real, and we fell apart slowly, gently, with all the kindness in the world.

The foghorns sound in the distance. The fog rolls in.

I close my laptop. I open it again.

Tomorrow.
