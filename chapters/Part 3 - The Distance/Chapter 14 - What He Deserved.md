# Chapter 14: What He Deserved

I didn't book the flight.

I walked to the door, I put my hand on the knob, and I stood there for a long time. Then I turned around, came back to my desk, and opened my laptop.

I am pathological. That's the only word for it. A disease of avoidance, a compulsion to retreat into words when the world demands action. I know what I should do, and I don't do it, and I keep not doing it, and the gap between knowing and doing grows wider every day.

My mother deserves better. Daniel deserved better. Everyone who has ever loved me has deserved better than what I gave them.

This chapter is about that. About deserving. About the debt I owe and cannot pay.

---

Let me tell you what Daniel deserved.

He deserved a husband who came home at the end of the day and was present. Not physically present—I managed that, most of the time—but mentally, emotionally present. A husband who asked about his day and listened to the answer. Who noticed when he was tired or stressed or sad. Who remembered the small things: his favorite coffee, the book he was reading, the friend he was worried about.

I used to be that husband. In the early years, before Pattern 7 consumed me, before the lab became my real home. I used to notice Daniel. I used to see him.

After the night in the lab, I stopped seeing. Not because I wanted to, not because I chose to, but because my vision had narrowed. I could only see the gap—the terrible distance between minds—and everything else became peripheral, blurred, unimportant.

Daniel was standing right in front of me, and I looked through him, toward a void he couldn't see.

---

He deserved honesty.

Not the brutal, total honesty that would have been its own kind of cruelty—I don't think he needed to know every thought in my head, every fear, every dark turn of my mind. But he deserved to know why I was pulling away. He deserved an explanation that was true, even if it was incomplete.

Instead, I gave him silence. I gave him "I'm fine" and "Just tired" and "I don't know how to explain it." I gave him the absence of explanation, which he filled with his own theories, his own wrong pictures.

Maybe that was a kind of honesty—admitting that I couldn't explain, that words failed me. But it was also a kind of cowardice. I could have tried harder. I could have kept trying, night after night, until something got through. Instead, I gave up. I decided the gap was unbridgeable and I stopped trying to bridge it.

Daniel deserved someone who kept trying.

---

He deserved effort.

This is what haunts me most. The asymmetry of effort in our marriage, especially in those last years.

Daniel tried everything. The books, the meals, the suggestions of therapy. He gave me space when I needed space, company when I seemed to want company. He rearranged his life around my withdrawal, adjusting his expectations, lowering the bar, finding ways to love me that didn't require me to be fully present.

And I? I put my effort elsewhere. Into the work, into the silence, into the slow construction of walls I told myself I wasn't building.

I watched Daniel try, and I didn't match his effort. I let him do the work of maintaining our relationship while I drifted, passive, consumed by something he couldn't see or understand.

That's not a partnership. That's not a marriage. That's one person carrying another, slowly wearing down under the weight.

The afternoon light is fading. I've been sitting here for hours, not writing, not calling, not doing anything useful.

Ewa sent a text: "Your mother asked for you this morning. She's sleeping now."

Four sentences. Neutral, informative, without reproach. But I can feel the accusation underneath. *Where are you? Why aren't you here? What kind of son does this?*

I don't have answers. I have only this chapter, this excavation of old guilt, this attempt to understand why I failed Daniel so that I can understand why I'm failing my mother now.

They're the same failure. The same pathology. The same inability to show up for the people who love me.

---

Let me tell you about the things I didn't do.

I didn't hold him enough. In those last years, I mean. We had been physical once—hands always touching, bodies gravitating toward each other, the casual intimacy of people who can't get enough of each other's presence. But that faded. I stopped reaching for him. I stopped initiating touch.

Daniel noticed. He had to notice—how could he not? But he didn't complain. He just... adjusted. He accepted the new normal, the distance that had crept into our bodies as well as our words.

I didn't ask about his life. His work, his friends, his inner world. I asked the superficial questions—"How was your day?"—but I didn't follow up. I didn't dig deeper. I didn't show the curiosity that love requires.

He told me things anyway. He kept trying to share himself with me, to maintain the connection even as I withdrew. I would half-listen, nodding in the right places, and then forget what he'd said within hours.

I didn't plan a future with him. We used to talk about what came next—where we might live when I was done with the project, whether we might get a dog, what retirement might look like. Those conversations stopped. I couldn't imagine a future, and I didn't tell him why, and the silence where our plans used to be grew louder every day.

---

He deserved joy.

This is the one that breaks me.

Daniel was a joyful person. Not in a loud way—he was never loud—but in a quiet, steady way. He found pleasure in small things: a good meal, a sunny afternoon, a book that moved him, a conversation with a friend. He had a gift for happiness, for being present in the moment without reaching for something else.

I used to share that joy. In the early years, his happiness was contagious. I would come home from the lab, stressed and tired, and he would be there with his calm presence and his gentle humor, and the stress would lift. He was my anchor, my ground, my way back to the ordinary world.

After the lab—after Pattern 12—I couldn't receive his joy anymore. It didn't reach me. I would see him happy, and I would feel nothing, or worse, I would feel resentment. *How can you be happy? Don't you see how alone we are? Don't you understand what I've seen?*

I didn't say any of this. I didn't poison his joy deliberately. But I didn't participate in it either. I stood outside, watching him be happy, unable to join.

That's a kind of abandonment too. To be physically present but emotionally absent, to receive someone's gifts and give nothing in return.

Daniel deserved someone who could receive his joy.

I need to stop making excuses.

Throughout this memoir, I've been explaining. Contextualizing. Showing you the structural reasons for my failure—the gap, the impossibility of transmission, the insight that broke me.

But reasons are not excuses. Understanding why I failed doesn't make the failure less real.

Daniel didn't care about the epistemology of communication. He didn't care about the structural limits of language. He cared about me—about us—about the life we were building together.

And I let that life crumble. Not through malice, not through intention, but through the slow accumulation of absences. I wasn't there, and I wasn't there, and I wasn't there, and eventually there was nothing left.

The reasons don't matter. The failure is what remains.

Dusk is falling. The light through the windows has turned golden, then orange, then grey.

I should call Ewa. I should tell her I'm coming, give her a flight number, make it real.

Instead, I'm sitting in the gathering dark, writing about Daniel, trying to understand why I couldn't be what he needed.

The answer is simple, and I've been avoiding it:

I was selfish.

Not consciously selfish, not the kind of selfishness that announces itself and makes demands. A quieter kind. The selfishness of someone so absorbed in their own suffering that they can't see anyone else's. The selfishness of grief, of crisis, of a wound that won't stop bleeding.

Daniel was suffering too. I know that now. Watching your spouse disappear into themselves, watching your marriage dissolve, watching your future shrink to nothing—that's its own kind of crisis. He needed support, comfort, presence.

And I gave him nothing. I was too busy drowning to notice he was drowning too.

---

Let me tell you about the guilt.

It came later, after the separation. In those first months alone, when I had nothing but time and silence and the echo of my own thoughts.

The guilt was not abstract. It was specific, detailed, comprehensive. I would lie awake at night and remember particular moments—particular failures—and cringe.

The birthday I forgot. The anniversary I treated as an ordinary day. The night he was sick and I stayed at the lab, telling myself the work was important, telling myself he'd be fine on his own.

The conversation he started about wanting to visit his parents' graves—he did this once a year, a pilgrimage to the cemetery where the people who had raised him were buried—and I said "That sounds nice" and changed the subject and never brought it up again.

The time he cried in the kitchen, quietly, thinking I couldn't hear, and I heard, and I didn't go to him. I stayed in the other room, pretending not to know, because I didn't have the strength to comfort someone else.

These moments came back to me, one after another, in the dark. They still come back.

---

Guilt is not useful. I know that. Guilt is self-indulgent, a way of making the failure about my feelings rather than about the harm I caused. Daniel wouldn't want me to wallow in guilt. He would want me to learn, to change, to be better.

But learning and changing require action. And action is what I can't seem to take.

My mother is dying in Kraków. I am sitting in a garage in California, writing about guilt. The distance between what I know and what I do is the same distance that killed my marriage.

Let me end this chapter with something I've never told anyone.

Three months before we separated, Daniel asked me a question. We were in bed, in the dark, in that space where conversations can happen because you don't have to look at each other.

"Do you still love me?"

I didn't hesitate. "Yes," I said. "I love you. I've always loved you."

"Then why does it feel like you don't?"

I turned toward him in the darkness. I couldn't see his face, but I could feel his presence, the warmth of his body, the years of history between us.

"I don't know," I said. "I love you. I just... I can't seem to show it anymore."

He was quiet for a long time. Then he said: "Love that can't be shown isn't love. It's just a feeling. And feelings don't mean anything if they don't reach the other person."

I wanted to argue. I wanted to say that love was more than action, that what I felt for him was real and deep and true, even if it couldn't find expression.

But he was right. Love that stays inside, that never becomes word or touch or presence—that's not love. That's just loneliness with a nicer name.

Daniel deserved love that reached him. Love that showed up. Love that did the work.

I gave him something else—something smaller, something insufficient. And he accepted it for as long as he could, and then he couldn't anymore.

---

It's fully dark now. I can see my reflection in the window—an old man, alone, surrounded by words that don't reach anyone.

Tomorrow I will go to Kraków. Tomorrow I will sit beside my mother's bed and try to be present, try to show up, try to give her the love that actually reaches.

Or I won't. I'll find another excuse, write another chapter, explain another failure.

The distance between what I should do and what I will do is the measure of who I am.

Daniel knew that. My mother knows that. I've known it my whole life.

The gap isn't just between minds. The gap is inside me. The gap between the person I want to be and the person I am.

---

I close my laptop. I sit in the dark. I listen to the silence.

Tomorrow, I tell myself.

But tomorrow is just a word. A postponement. A lie I tell to make the present bearable.

The truth is simpler and harder:

I don't know if I can be what anyone deserves.

I have never known.
