# Chapter 13: The Silence Between

There are different kinds of silence.

I've been thinking about this as I sit here, not writing, not booking a flight, not doing any of the things I should be doing. Just sitting in the grey morning light, listening to the fog drip from the eaves.

The silence in this garage is different from the silence in our old apartment. That silence was filled with presence—Daniel's presence, the hum of the refrigerator, the distant sounds of Berkeley life. It was a silence between things, a pause in an ongoing conversation.

The silence now is emptier. More complete. The silence of a man alone with his thoughts, no one waiting for him to speak.

Both kinds of silence are painful. But they're painful in different ways, and I've been trying, for twenty years, to understand the difference.

Ewa stopped calling.

I noticed it yesterday—the absence of her name on my phone, the relief and guilt that came with the absence. She had called every day for a week. Now, nothing.

I told myself she was busy. The hospital, the arrangements, the endless logistics of a parent dying. She didn't have time to chase a wayward cousin who wouldn't commit to a flight.

But I knew that wasn't it. I knew she had given up on me, the way people eventually give up on those who won't be reached.

My mother is dying, and I have exhausted the patience of the people who love her.

---

Let me tell you about the months after the failed attempt.

Time passed. That's the strange thing about grief—it doesn't stop time, doesn't slow it down, doesn't make the clocks run backward to before the wound. Time just keeps moving, carrying you forward whether you want to go or not.

Daniel and I developed routines. Morning coffee, evening meals, weekends that looked from the outside like any other couple's weekends. We went to restaurants and movies and friends' houses. We laughed at jokes and complained about work and made plans for a future we both suspected wouldn't arrive.

But underneath the routines, something had changed. The silence between us had thickened. It was no longer a pause—it was a presence. A third entity in our apartment, taking up space, breathing its own slow breath.

We stopped talking about the signals.

This happened gradually, without anyone deciding it should happen. I stopped bringing up my work; Daniel stopped asking. The topic became a kind of no-man's-land, fenced off by mutual unspoken agreement. We talked about everything else—politics, weather, his job, our families—but not about the thing that had broken me.

I think Daniel was relieved. The signal talk confused him, made him feel inadequate, reminded him of the gap he couldn't bridge. By avoiding it, we could pretend the gap wasn't there.

I was relieved too, in a way. Every time I tried to explain, I failed. The failures accumulated, each one adding to the weight I carried. By not talking, I could at least stop making things worse.

But silence has its own weight. Silence accrues interest. The things we don't say pile up between us, invisible but solid, until we can barely see each other across the heap.

---

One night—I don't remember exactly when, sometime in late 2043—Daniel said: "I feel like I'm losing you."

We were in bed. The lights were off. I couldn't see his face, only the shape of him in the darkness.

"You're not losing me," I said.

"Then why can't I reach you?"

I didn't answer. The silence stretched, filling the room.

"Tom. Talk to me."

I opened my mouth. I felt the familiar paralysis—the slack jaw, the emptiness where words should be. I had tried so many times. Every attempt had failed. Every attempt had made the distance greater.

"I don't know how," I said finally.

"You used to know how. We used to talk about everything."

He was right. We did. In the early years, we would stay up late, talking and talking, the words flowing between us like water. We told each other everything—our pasts, our fears, our half-formed thoughts about the future. Language had been our bridge, our bond, our way of touching across the gap.

And now the bridge was gone. Not broken—just gone. Revealed as illusion, as a structure that had never really held weight.

"I know," I said. "I'm sorry."

"Stop apologizing. I don't want apologies. I want you. I want to know what's happening inside your head."

Inside my head was the void. The terrible openness I had glimpsed in the lab, the understanding that minds are islands, that words are rafts that never quite reach the shore.

"I can't," I said. "I can't explain it."

The silence returned. Longer this time. Heavier.

Then Daniel said, very quietly: "Are you leaving me?"

"No," I said. "No. I love you."

"Then why does it feel like you're already gone?"

I had no answer. I reached out in the darkness and found his hand, and I held it, and we lay there together, two people sharing a bed and occupying different worlds.

---

The sun is trying to break through the fog. I can see it—a bright smear in the grey, a promise of warmth that hasn't arrived yet.

I should book the flight. I should call Ewa, apologize, tell her I'm coming.

Instead, I'm thinking about all the conversations Daniel and I didn't have. All the silences that accumulated between us, each one a small failure, a tiny surrender.

The silence with my mother is the same kind of silence. Not hostile—never hostile—just empty. The conversations we might have had if I had been different, if she had been different, if the gap between us had been something that words could cross.

I used to blame myself. I used to think if I had just tried harder, found the right words, been more patient—then Daniel would have understood, then my mother would have understood, then the loneliness would have lifted.

Now I know better. The gap isn't a failure of effort. The gap is real. It exists between all minds, and no amount of trying can close it.

This should be a comfort. It isn't.

---

Let me tell you about the small failures.

There was the evening Daniel asked how work was going, and I said "Fine," and he nodded, and we both let the lie stand.

There was the morning I woke early and sat in the kitchen, watching the sun rise, and Daniel found me there and asked what I was thinking about. "Nothing," I said. "Just couldn't sleep." And he made coffee and sat with me, and we watched the light change together, and neither of us said what we were really thinking.

There was the night we went to dinner with friends—Yusuf and his wife, a professor from the physics department and her partner—and the conversation turned to the project, to the signals, to the latest theories about what they might mean. I sat there, smiling, nodding, saying the expected things, and inside I was screaming.

*You don't understand,* I wanted to say. *None of you understand. The theories are wrong, all of them, and the truth is worse than you can imagine.*

But I didn't say it. I played my role. I maintained the fiction.

Daniel watched me from across the table. I could feel his eyes on me, reading something in my face that I couldn't hide. Afterward, in the car, he said: "You seemed far away tonight."

"Just tired," I said.

He didn't push. He never pushed. That was part of the problem—his kindness, his patience, the way he gave me space to fail and fail again.

---

I'm going to tell you something I've never told anyone.

In those months, the months of small failures and accumulating silence, I sometimes wished Daniel would get angry.

I wished he would yell at me. Demand answers. Accuse me of shutting him out, of being selfish, of ruining our marriage with my refusal to communicate.

Anger would have been easier. Anger would have been a bridge of sorts—a way to meet across the gap, even if the meeting was hostile. Anger would have meant he was still trying, still fighting, still believing that the distance could be crossed.

Instead, he was patient. He was understanding. He absorbed my silences without complaint, made excuses for my distance, loved me in the way a person loves someone they're slowly losing.

His patience was a kind of grief. I see that now. He was grieving the marriage while still living in it, preparing himself for the loss that was coming.

And I—I was too lost in my own grief to see his. Too absorbed in the gap I had discovered to notice the gap I was creating.

---

There's something I need to say about the signals.

During those months, I kept working. I went to the lab, ran analyses, attended meetings. From the outside, I looked like a productive researcher making steady progress on a long-term project.

But inside, everything had changed. I looked at the data differently now. I saw the signals not as puzzles to be solved but as presences—minds reaching out across the void, speaking languages no one else could understand, isolated in their own semantic universes.

I started to feel a kinship with them. The aliens, whoever or whatever they were, were as alone as I was. They sent their transmissions into the cosmos, hoping for response, knowing that response was impossible. Their words would reach us, and we would try to understand, and we would fail, and the gap would remain.

This was not a comforting thought. But it was, in its way, a kind of company. I was alone, but I was alone together with every mind that had ever tried to reach another and failed.

---

The fog is lifting. I can see the neighbor's house now, the trees in their backyard, the hills in the distance. The world is reappearing, piece by piece.

I should take this as a sign. I should book the flight, pack a bag, go to Kraków. The fog is lifting; I should lift with it.

But I don't move. I sit here, watching the world emerge, thinking about all the silences.

---

Let me tell you about the last silence.

Not the last silence between Daniel and me—that came later, much later, and I'll tell you about it when I'm ready.

But a silence that felt like an ending. A silence that made me understand how far we had drifted.

It was a Saturday afternoon. Daniel was reading in the living room; I was at my desk, pretending to work. We had been in the apartment together all day, barely speaking, the silence between us so thick I could almost touch it.

I looked up from my screen and watched him. He was absorbed in his book, face calm, body relaxed. He looked peaceful. He looked like a man who had made his peace with something difficult.

And I realized: he had stopped waiting.

All those months, Daniel had been waiting. Waiting for me to come back, to open up, to explain what was happening. His patience had been a form of hope—the belief that eventually, if he just gave me enough time, I would return to him.

But now he had stopped. I could see it in the set of his shoulders, the ease of his breathing. He had accepted that I was gone. He was making his peace with the absence.

I should have felt relief. Finally, he understood. Finally, he had stopped expecting something I couldn't give.

But I didn't feel relief. I felt terror. Because his acceptance meant he was beginning to leave me. Not physically—we would stay together for another two years, sharing the apartment, sharing the bed, sharing the silence. But emotionally, he was starting to go.

I wanted to stand up and cross the room and take his face in my hands and say: *Don't give up. Don't accept this. Fight for me. Make me explain.*

But I didn't. I sat at my desk and watched him read, and I said nothing, and the silence swelled around us like rising water.

---

That was the moment the marriage ended. Not the divorce, not the conversation where we agreed to separate, not the day he moved out. That Saturday afternoon, watching Daniel make his peace with my absence—that was when it ended.

Everything after that was epilogue.

---

I've been writing for hours. The sun is high now, the fog a memory. The bay glitters in the distance, blue and indifferent.

I'm going to close my laptop. I'm going to walk to the kitchen and make lunch. I'm going to do the normal things, the daily things, the things that fill the time between silences.

And then—maybe—I'll book the flight.

My mother is dying. The silence between us has lasted decades. There's nothing I can say that will bridge it, nothing I can do that will undo the years of distance.

But I can go. I can sit beside her bed and hold her hand and be present in my body, even if my words fail.

That's something. It's not enough, but it's something.

The silence between us will remain. But at least we'll be silent together.

---

Tomorrow.

No—not tomorrow. I've said that too many times.

Today. This afternoon. I'll book the flight this afternoon.

I close my laptop. I stand up. I walk to the door.

I don't look back.
