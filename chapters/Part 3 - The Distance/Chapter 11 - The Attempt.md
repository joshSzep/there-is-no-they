# Chapter 11: The Attempt

I called Ewa. I told her I would book a flight. I said the words, and I meant them when I said them.

That was yesterday. It is now the following morning, and I am sitting at my desk again, and I have not booked the flight.

I opened the airline website. I looked at the options: SFO to Warsaw, then a connection to Kraków, arriving tomorrow evening. Sixteen hours of travel, three time zones, a world away. I looked at the prices, the seat maps, the departure times.

And then I closed the browser and opened this document instead.

I don't know what's wrong with me. That's not true—I know exactly what's wrong with me. I am afraid. Not of flying, not of Poland, not even of watching my mother die. I am afraid of arriving too late, of standing at her bedside with nothing to say, of failing her in death the way I have failed her in life.

So I sit here writing about Daniel. About the night I tried to explain, and the way his face changed as he listened, and the distance that opened between us and never closed.

This is cowardice. I know it's cowardice. But cowardice is what I have.

---

Let me tell you about his face.

I've spent twenty years trying to describe that face. The specific expression, the precise configuration of features, the moment when understanding became misunderstanding. Every time I try, the words slip away from me. Language was made for faces—we have a thousand words for how people look—and yet this face defeats me.

But I have to try. That's what this memoir is. An attempt, over and over, to say the unsayable. A failure repeated until it becomes something else—not success, but at least effort. At least witness.

Daniel's face, on the night I tried to explain.

---

It was a Sunday. Three weeks and four days after the night in the lab. I had told Yusuf, which had broken something loose, made me feel that perhaps I could speak after all. I had decided: tonight I would tell Daniel.

We had dinner at home. I cooked—badly, as usual—and he ate it without complaint, as he always did. We talked about nothing: his work, a podcast he was listening to, a trip we might take in the fall. Normal conversation. The kind we'd had a thousand times before.

After dinner, we moved to the couch. This was our ritual: dishes in the sink, lights dimmed, the two of us side by side in the soft glow of the evening. Sometimes we watched something. Sometimes we just talked. Sometimes we sat in comfortable silence, each of us occupied with our own thoughts.

That night, I said: "I need to tell you something."

He turned to look at me. His face was open, attentive, ready to receive whatever I had to say. This was Daniel's gift: he could make you feel heard before you'd spoken a word. His eyes, his posture, the way he angled his body toward you—all of it said *I'm here, I'm listening, you matter.*

"What is it?"

And I tried to tell him.

---

I started with the facts. The test on Pattern 12. The cross-checks. The seventeen contradictions. I laid it out the way I had for Yusuf: clinical, precise, the scientist explaining a result.

Daniel listened. He asked a few questions—clarifying questions, the kind that showed he was tracking the technical details even if he didn't fully understand them. He nodded at the right moments. He was doing everything right.

I moved from the facts to the implications. This was harder. I tried to explain what it meant that my model was local—that Pattern 7's grammar didn't apply to Pattern 12. I tried to explain why this mattered, why it wasn't just a setback but a fundamental shift in how I understood the signals.

Daniel kept listening. But now his face began to change.

---

I need to stop here and describe the change. This is the hard part.

It wasn't confusion. Daniel was intelligent; he understood the concepts I was explaining. It wasn't boredom—he cared about my work, had always cared, even when the technical details were beyond him. It wasn't impatience or frustration or any of the other faces we make when someone is taking too long to get to the point.

It was something else. Something I didn't have a word for then, and don't quite have a word for now.

The closest I can come is this: he was making a picture.

As I talked, I could see him constructing an image in his mind. Taking my words and arranging them into a shape that made sense. This is what we do when we listen—we translate the sounds into meanings, the meanings into structures, the structures into understanding. It's automatic. We can't help it.

Daniel was doing this. And the picture he was making was wrong.

Not completely wrong—that would have been easier. If he had misunderstood entirely, I could have corrected him, started over, tried again. But his picture was close. Close enough that he thought he understood. Close enough that correction would seem like nitpicking, like I was quibbling over details when he had grasped the essence.

The essence was exactly what he hadn't grasped.

---

How do I explain this?

Imagine you're trying to describe the color blue to someone who has never seen it. You say: "It's the color of the sky on a clear day. It's the color of the ocean. It's cool, peaceful, associated with calm."

And the person nods. They form a picture. They think they understand "blue."

But they don't. They've understood the associations, the contexts, the emotional connotations. They know *about* blue. But they don't know blue. The actual experience of seeing blue—the qualia, the raw sensation—is something your words couldn't touch.

That's what was happening with Daniel. As I talked about Pattern 12 and the failure of my model, he was building an understanding based on analogies, associations, things he already knew. He was mapping my words onto his existing mental frameworks, finding correlations, making connections.

And the connections were wrong. Not because he was stupid or careless, but because the thing I was trying to describe didn't fit in any framework he possessed. It was new. It was outside. It required something more than analogical reasoning—it required a kind of seeing that couldn't be transmitted through language.

---

I watched his face as he listened. I watched the small movements—the slight furrow of the brow, the occasional nod, the shifting of his gaze as he processed what I was saying. And I felt a terrible, helpless frustration building in my chest.

I wanted to reach into his skull and adjust the picture. I wanted to say: *No, not like that. Like this.* But I couldn't show him "this." I only had words, and words were the problem.

After about fifteen minutes, I stopped talking. Not because I was done—I had barely started—but because I could feel the gap opening. Every sentence I spoke was making it worse. Every explanation was creating more misunderstanding, not less.

Daniel was quiet for a moment. Then he said:

"So... the model only works for one signal? And you're worried it won't generalize?"

It was a reasonable summary. A perfectly accurate paraphrase of what I had said. And it was completely wrong.

---

I don't know how to explain why it was wrong. That's the whole problem—I've spent twenty years not knowing how to explain, and I don't know now, and I'll never know.

But I can tell you what happened to my body when Daniel said those words.

Something closed in my chest. Not physically—my heart kept beating, my lungs kept breathing—but emotionally. A door that had been open, hoping for connection, swung shut.

I looked at Daniel's face—that kind, intelligent, loving face—and I understood that he would never see what I had seen. Not because he was incapable, but because what I had seen couldn't be transmitted. The gap between minds was real, and language couldn't bridge it.

I understood this, and I felt, for the first time, truly alone.

---

I'm writing this in the morning light. The fog is thin today—I can see the bay through it, a blue shimmer in the distance. My phone has stopped ringing; Ewa must have given up for now.

I should book the flight. I should go. But I'm sitting here instead, writing about Daniel, because the failure I'm describing is the same failure that keeps me from my mother.

The attempt to explain. The certainty that the explanation will be wrong. The loneliness of knowing what others don't know, and the paralysis that comes with it.

---

Let me tell you what I said to Daniel, after he offered his summary.

I said: "It's more than that."

He waited. His face was still open, still ready to listen. He thought I was going to elaborate, to clarify, to help him understand better.

But I couldn't. The words had dried up. Everything I could think to say would only deepen the misunderstanding, would only make his picture more complete and more wrong.

"More than that how?" he asked.

I opened my mouth. I closed it. I shook my head.

"I don't know how to say it."

This was true. It was the truest thing I had said all evening. But Daniel heard it differently than I meant it. He heard it as *I don't have the words yet, give me time.* He didn't hear it as *there are no words, there can never be words, the words themselves are the problem.*

"Take your time," he said. "I'm not going anywhere."

And he reached out and took my hand, and he squeezed it gently, and the gesture broke my heart.

Because it was kind. Because it was patient. Because it was exactly what a loving husband should do when his partner is struggling to express something difficult.

And because it didn't help. It couldn't help. All the kindness in the world couldn't bridge the gap I was falling into.

---

We sat there for a long time. Daniel held my hand and waited, and I sat beside him and couldn't speak.

Eventually, he said: "Is this about the signals not being related? Like they're from different... civilizations?"

Again, a reasonable interpretation. Again, completely wrong.

"No," I said. "I mean, yes, but... it's not about where they come from. It's about what they are. What language is. What understanding means."

He nodded slowly. I could see him incorporating this new information into his picture, adjusting the shape, trying to make it fit.

"So it's more philosophical," he said. "Like, the discovery raises questions about the nature of communication?"

I almost laughed. It came out as a kind of choked sound, something between a sob and a cough.

"Yes," I said. "Something like that."

It was a surrender. I was giving up, accepting his interpretation, letting the wrong picture stand because correcting it would require a miracle I didn't have.

Daniel must have sensed something. His brow furrowed slightly, and he said: "I feel like I'm not getting it. Can you try again?"

And I looked at him—this man I had married, this person I had chosen above all others, who knew me better than anyone in the world—and I said:

"I don't think I can."

---

I need to be clear about what happened next.

Daniel didn't get angry. He didn't accuse me of shutting him out, didn't demand that I try harder, didn't make it about himself. He was gracious, as he always was. He said:

"Okay. That's okay. Maybe you just need more time to process it."

"Maybe," I said.

"And when you're ready to talk more, I'm here."

"I know."

He squeezed my hand again, and we sat in silence, and eventually he turned on a movie—something light, something we'd seen before—and we watched it without really watching, side by side on the couch, close enough to touch.

From the outside, we looked like any couple on any Sunday night. Comfortable. Connected. Together.

But I knew, even then, that something had shifted. The failed attempt had opened a distance that I didn't know how to close. Not a dramatic rupture—nothing you could point to and say *that's when it went wrong*—but a subtle drift. A drift that would continue for months, years, until the distance between us was uncrossable.

---

I've thought about that night a thousand times. I've replayed the conversation, examined every word, asked myself what I could have done differently.

And the answer, I think, is: nothing.

The failure wasn't in my execution. It wasn't that I chose the wrong words, the wrong approach, the wrong moment. The failure was inherent in the attempt. The thing I was trying to communicate couldn't be communicated—not to Daniel, not to anyone. It had to be experienced directly, and experience can't be transmitted.

This is what I learned that night. This is what the next twenty years would confirm again and again. You can share information. You can share facts, data, descriptions. But you cannot share understanding. The gap between minds is real, and love doesn't bridge it, and patience doesn't bridge it, and even perfect words—if there were such things—wouldn't bridge it.

---

The sun is higher now. I've been writing for hours.

My mother is dying in Kraków, and I am sitting in California writing about a conversation from twenty years ago. There is something deeply wrong with this. I know there is. But I can't seem to stop.

Maybe this is the only way I know to grieve. Maybe writing about Daniel is a way of preparing myself for my mother—rehearsing the loss, the distance, the unbridgeable gap.

Or maybe I'm just avoiding. Using words as a shield, as I've always done. Hiding in abstraction while the real world waits.

Either way, I'm still here. Still writing. Still not on a plane.

---

Let me end with this:

That night, after the movie ended, Daniel and I went to bed. We lay beside each other in the dark, close but not touching.

Just before I fell asleep, he said: "I love you. Whatever it is, whatever's happening—I love you."

"I love you too," I said.

And I meant it. I have never stopped meaning it. But even then, in that moment, I understood that love wasn't enough. That the distance I had traveled in that lab was a distance Daniel couldn't follow, no matter how much he wanted to.

He stayed. He tried. For three more years, he stayed and tried, and I stayed and tried, and we both did everything we could think of to bridge the gap.

But the gap was unbridgeable. That's what this story is about. The gap between minds, the failure of language, the loneliness of seeing.

Daniel's face that night—open, kind, making the wrong picture—is the face I've been trying to describe for twenty years.

I still can't describe it. I never will.

But I'll keep trying anyway. That's the only answer I have.

Attempt after attempt, failure after failure, reaching across the gap.

Until there's no one left to reach for.
