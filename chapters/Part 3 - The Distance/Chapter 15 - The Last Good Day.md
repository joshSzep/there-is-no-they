# Chapter 15: The Last Good Day

Was there a last good day?

I've been trying to remember. Sifting through the years, looking for a moment that shines—a day when Daniel and I were still us, still together in the way that matters, before the distance became permanent.

The problem is that good days don't announce themselves. You don't wake up thinking: *This is the last time we'll be happy. Pay attention.* You just live through them, taking them for granted, assuming there will be more.

And then there aren't.

I booked the flight.

I'm writing this in the airport, waiting for my connection in Chicago. Sixteen hours to Kraków, with a layover in Warsaw. I'll arrive tomorrow evening, if everything goes smoothly.

Ewa texted: "Thank God. I'll pick you up."

Nothing else. No reproach, no relief, just the practical fact of my arrival. She's given up expecting more from me. She'll take what she can get.

My mother doesn't know I'm coming. Ewa thought it would be better as a surprise, in case I don't make it in time. *In case I don't make it.* The words hung in the air between us, unspoken.

So I sit here in O'Hare, surrounded by strangers, writing about the last good day with Daniel. As if memory could be a substitute for presence. As if words could be a kind of arrival.

Let me tell you about November 17th, 2044.

I'm not certain this was the last good day. Maybe there were later ones, smaller ones, days I've forgotten. But this is the one I remember. This is the one I return to when I want to believe we were still something, even at the end.

It was a Saturday. We slept in, both of us—unusual for me, who usually woke with the sun, thinking about work. But that morning I stayed in bed, half-awake, feeling the warmth of Daniel beside me.

The light came through the curtains, soft and grey. November in Berkeley: not cold exactly, but cool, the trees half-bare, the air carrying the first hints of winter.

Daniel stirred. He made a sound—not quite a word, just a warm noise of waking—and turned toward me. His eyes were still closed, but he was smiling.

"Hi," he said.

"Hi."

We lay there for a while, not speaking. Just breathing together, bodies touching, the silence comfortable in a way it hadn't been for months.

And I thought: *We could still make this work. We could still find our way back.*

---

The thought surprised me.

I had given up, I realize now. Somewhere in the previous year, I had accepted that Daniel and I were over. Not ended—we still lived together, still shared a bed, still performed the rituals of marriage—but over. Finished in some essential way, just waiting for the paperwork.

But that morning, lying beside him in the grey light, I felt something else. A flicker of possibility. A door that might not be completely closed.

I don't know what caused it. Maybe it was the sleep, the rest, the rare experience of waking without the lab already calling me. Maybe it was the simple animal comfort of his body next to mine. Maybe it was luck, or chance, or the mysterious chemistry of mood.

Whatever it was, I felt it. For that morning, I felt like the gap might be crossable after all.

---

We made breakfast together.

This sounds small. It was small. But we hadn't done it in months—cooked side by side, handing each other ingredients, moving around each other in the small kitchen with the ease of long practice.

Daniel made eggs. I made coffee, sliced bread, set the table. We didn't talk much, but the silence was different. Not the heavy silence of distance, but the light silence of people who don't need to fill every moment with words.

We sat at the table by the window. The fog was burning off, revealing the bay in patches, blue and silver.

"This is nice," Daniel said.

"Yeah," I said. "It is."

We ate. The eggs were good—Daniel always made good eggs, something about the way he handled the heat. The coffee was strong. The bread was slightly stale, but neither of us cared.

For that hour, we were a couple having breakfast on a Saturday morning. Nothing more, nothing less. The gap was still there, somewhere underneath, but we weren't falling into it. We were standing together on solid ground.

---

They're calling my flight. I need to board soon.

I'm writing faster now, trying to capture the day before I lose it again. The memory is fragile—it flickers and fades, and I'm afraid that if I don't pin it down in words, it will disappear entirely.

But words are the wrong container. Words can't hold the quality of that morning—the light, the warmth, the brief impossible feeling that we might survive.

I write anyway. Because words are all I have.

---

After breakfast, we went for a walk.

This was Daniel's suggestion. "Let's go somewhere," he said. "It's been so long since we just... went somewhere."

He was right. Our weekends had become routine: errands, chores, the low-grade maintenance of a shared life. We rarely went anywhere for the pleasure of it.

"Where?" I asked.

"Anywhere. The marina. Tilden Park. Somewhere with trees."

We chose Tilden. We drove up into the hills, parked at the nature center, and started walking. The trails were quiet—too cold for most people, too grey—but we had jackets, and we had each other, and that was enough.

I remember the eucalyptus trees, their bark peeling in long strips, their smell sharp and clean. I remember the sound of our footsteps on the path, the occasional bird, the distant murmur of the city below. I remember Daniel's hand, reaching for mine, and the surprise of the contact, how long it had been since we'd walked hand in hand.

We walked for an hour, maybe more. We talked about nothing in particular—the trees, the weather, a movie we'd seen, a memory from our early days together. Light talk. Surface talk. But surface can be beautiful. Surface can be a relief, after months of trying to go deep and failing.

At some point, Daniel stopped walking. We were at a viewpoint, looking out over the bay, the fog now completely gone, the water shining in the late-morning sun.

"Tom," he said.

I turned to look at him.

"I know things have been hard. I know you're going through something I don't fully understand. But I want you to know—I'm still here. I'm not going anywhere."

He said it simply, without drama. A statement of fact. A promise.

I should have said something back. I should have told him I loved him, that I was sorry, that I was trying. I should have opened up, even a little, given him something to hold on to.

Instead, I just nodded. And we kept walking.

But I remember the moment. I remember his face, open and sincere, offering himself to me one more time. I remember the way the light caught his hair, the slight wind ruffling it, the bay behind him stretching toward the horizon.

I remember thinking: *I don't deserve this. I don't deserve him.*

The gate is boarding now. Final call.

I'm going to close my laptop and get on the plane. I'm going to fly across the ocean to sit beside my dying mother.

But first, let me finish the day.

---

We came home in the early afternoon. We made lunch—simple, sandwiches and soup—and ate it on the couch, watching an old movie. Something we'd seen before, something comforting.

Daniel fell asleep with his head on my shoulder.

I sat very still, not wanting to wake him. I listened to his breathing, felt the weight of him against me, watched the movie without seeing it.

And I thought: *Maybe this is enough. Maybe we don't need to bridge the gap completely. Maybe we can just have moments like this, small islands of connection, and that can be a life.*

It was a hopeful thought. A fragile thought. A thought that wouldn't survive the following weeks, the following months, the slow grinding dissolution that was coming.

But in that moment, with Daniel asleep on my shoulder and the afternoon light filling the room, I believed it. I believed we could make it.

---

The day ended, as days do.

Daniel woke up. We ordered dinner—Thai food, from the place we liked. We ate and talked and watched another movie. We went to bed.

Nothing dramatic happened. No crisis, no revelation, no turning point. Just an ordinary day, better than most, a glimpse of what we'd been and might still be.

I didn't know it was the last good day. How could I? It felt like the beginning of something, not the end.

But looking back, I can see: that was as good as it got. After November 17th, 2044, the distance only grew. The silence deepened. The brief opening that had appeared that morning closed again, and this time it didn't reopen.

---

I'm on the plane now. Somewhere over the Atlantic, the world dark outside my window, the cabin quiet around me.

My mother is dying. I am flying toward her, finally, after all the delays, all the excuses, all the chapters written instead of flights booked.

And I'm thinking about the last good day. About how you never know, in the moment, that it's the last. About how you only recognize it later, looking back, when the good days have stopped coming.

I wonder if there will be a last good day with my mother. Maybe it's already happened. Maybe it was years ago, some visit I barely remember, some afternoon in her kitchen that meant more than I knew.

Or maybe it's still coming. Maybe I'll arrive in time, and we'll have a day—an hour, a minute—that shines. One more moment of connection before the end.

---

I'm going to sleep now. Or try to. The plane hums around me, carrying me toward Kraków, toward whatever is waiting.

Daniel and I had a last good day. We didn't know it was the last. We lived it, and it passed, and afterward came only the long slow fade.

But we had it. For one day, one morning, one walk in the hills, we were still us. The gap didn't disappear, but we stood on the same side of it, looking out at the view together.

I hold onto that. I have to hold onto something.

Maybe, when I arrive, my mother and I will have our own last good day. Or maybe we won't. Maybe the good days are already gone, and all that's left is the ending.

Either way, I'm going. Finally, after everything, I'm going.

The plane carries me through the night. Below us, the ocean, vast and dark. Ahead of us, the dawn.

I close my eyes. I remember Daniel's head on my shoulder, the warmth of his body, the fragile hope of that November afternoon.

I hold onto it. I hold onto everything I can.

And I wait for morning.
