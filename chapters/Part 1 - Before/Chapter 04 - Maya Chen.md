# Chapter 4: Maya Chen

I saw her on television last year.

She's seventy-three now, my age, her hair silver, her face lined in ways that suggest she has laughed more than I have. She was being interviewed about something—the anniversary of the discovery, I think, one of those retrospectives the networks produce when they need to fill airtime. "Forty years since we learned we weren't alone."

She handled it gracefully. She always did. The questions were soft, nostalgic, and she answered them with the practiced warmth of someone who has told the same stories a thousand times. Yes, it was an accident. Yes, she almost didn't notice. Yes, it changed everything.

They didn't ask about the collapse. They never do, in these pieces. The story they want is the discovery, the hope, the moment when humanity's loneliness ended. Not what came after. Not the twenty years of work that led nowhere, the billions spent on a premise that turned out to be false, the man who proved it wrong.

They didn't mention me.

I was grateful for that. I turned off the television and sat in the silence, thinking about Maya Chen, about who she was and who she became, about the institution she built and I unmade.

The coffee is cold again. I should stop making coffee if I'm not going to drink it, but the ritual matters: the grinding, the pouring, the illusion that I am beginning something.

Another day. Another chapter. Another deferral of the flight I should have taken three days ago.

My mother is dying. Maya Chen is alive, somewhere, doing interviews and attending anniversaries. The world turns, indifferent to the fact that I am sitting in a garage, writing a story no one has asked for.

Let me tell you about Maya.

---

She was thirty-two when she made the discovery. The same age I was when I arrived at Berkeley, full of languages and certainty. We were born the same year, though I didn't learn this until later. Two babies born in 1991, on opposite sides of the world—one in San Jose, California, the daughter of engineers who had immigrated from Taiwan; one in Kraków, Poland, the son of an alcoholic and a woman who survived him.

Different lives, different trajectories, converging on the same building in 2033.

By then, of course, she was already famous. The Chen Discovery—her name attached to it like a brand, indelible. The woman who heard the universe. The face of first contact. Her photograph in every publication, her voice on every broadcast, her story told and retold until it became myth.

The myth went like this: A brilliant young graduate student, working late in the lab, makes a computational error. Instead of filtering out the noise in the cosmic background, she amplifies it. And in that amplified noise, she sees something impossible—structure, pattern, intention. The static of the universe is not static at all. It's a message. Millions of messages, overlapping, ancient and new, from civilizations scattered across the cosmos.

It's a good myth. Simple, dramatic, the lone genius catching what everyone else missed. Maya told it well, refining it over the years until every beat was perfect. The late night. The mistake. The moment of recognition.

What the myth left out: she wasn't alone in the lab. She wasn't a lone genius. She was part of a team, working on signal processing algorithms for a survey project. The "mistake" was a parameter setting that her advisor had suggested she try. The "recognition" took weeks, as she and a dozen colleagues verified what they thought they were seeing.

I don't say this to diminish her. She did see it first. She did push when others might have dismissed it. She deserves the credit she received.

But the myth made her something more than human. And when you become more than human, you lose the ability to be wrong.

I met her in person for the first time three months after I arrived.

By then, the Chen Building was under construction—the glass-and-steel monument to her discovery, rising at the edge of campus. She held weekly "office hours" for new staff, a chance to meet the legend, to shake her hand and receive her blessing.

I didn't want to go. I have never been comfortable with celebrity, with the performance of admiration that celebrity requires. But Daniel insisted.

"You have to," he said. "She's the reason we're all here. The least you can do is introduce yourself."

So I went. I stood in line with the other new hires, shuffling forward every few minutes, rehearsing what I would say. Something about linguistics, about pattern recognition, about what I hoped to contribute. Something that would make me memorable without seeming arrogant.

When I reached the front of the line, she was sitting behind a table, flanked by handlers. She looked tired—the tiredness of someone who has smiled too much, talked too much, been looked at too much. But she smiled at me anyway.

"Tomasz Kowalski," she read from a card someone had handed her. "Computational linguistics. Twelve languages." She looked up, eyebrows raised. "Twelve?"

"Yes."

"I speak one and a half. Mandarin from my grandmother, enough to order food and disappoint her." She laughed, inviting me to laugh with her. I managed a smile.

"Your work on tonal pattern recognition," she continued. "I read the abstract. Interesting approach."

I doubted she had read anything more than the abstract. She was meeting fifty people that day; she couldn't possibly have read all their work. But it was a kind lie, and I appreciated it.

"I hope it's useful," I said.

"I'm sure it will be. We need people who can see patterns. That's all this is, really—patterns waiting to be seen." She extended her hand. I shook it. Her grip was firm, her palm dry. "Welcome to the project, Tomasz. I look forward to seeing what you find."

I said something—thank you, probably, or something equally forgettable—and moved on. The whole interaction took ninety seconds.

I remember thinking: she believes it. She really believes we're going to decode these signals. She believes it's just a matter of time, effort, the right people seeing the right patterns.

I envied that belief. I wanted it for myself.

The signal translation project, in its early years, was chaos.

Organized chaos, but chaos nonetheless. Hundreds of researchers, dozens of disciplines, petabytes of data, and no one quite sure how to proceed. The signals had been discovered, but discovering and understanding are not the same thing.

Maya's public role was clear: she was the face, the voice, the storyteller. She explained the project to Congress, to the UN, to the cameras that followed her everywhere. She translated our work into words the world could understand, compressing years of uncertainty into soundbites of hope.

Her private role was less clear. She was not, technically, a scientist anymore—not in the sense of doing research, running experiments, sitting at a desk and staring at data. She was a director, a fundraiser, a diplomat. She managed the institution rather than the work.

This bothered some people. I heard the grumbling in hallways, in break rooms, in the quiet corners where researchers complained to each other. "She doesn't understand what we're doing." "She hasn't written a paper in years." "She takes credit for work she can't even read."

I didn't join these complaints, but I understood them. There is a particular resentment reserved for those who rise above the work—who escape the grinding labor of research and ascend to a realm of speeches and interviews and glossy photographs. Especially when the rise is based on accident, on luck, on being in the right place when a mistake turned out to be a discovery.

But I also saw what Maya did that the grumblers didn't see. The funding that materialized when budgets should have been cut. The political cover when results failed to meet expectations. The narrative that kept the public engaged, year after year, despite the absence of dramatic breakthroughs.

She was holding the project together. Not with science, but with story.

---

I didn't see her often, in those early years. She existed at a different altitude—press conferences and board meetings while I sat at my desk on the fourth floor, running models that failed.

But I watched her. Everyone watched her. She was the visible manifestation of what we were doing, the face we showed the world. When she gave interviews, we gathered in break rooms to watch. When she published op-eds, we passed them around and dissected them. When she walked through the building—rare, but it happened—conversations stopped, heads turned, the air itself seemed to thicken with attention.

She handled it well. She was gracious, approachable, remembering names she must have heard only once. She asked questions that sounded genuine, even when they probably weren't. She made people feel seen, which is a talent more rare than any scientific ability.

I don't know if I liked her. That seems like the wrong question. You don't like or dislike a force of nature; you simply acknowledge its power and try to stay out of its path.

In 2035, I was assigned to Pattern 7.

This was not Maya's decision—she had deputies for that, people who matched researchers to signals based on skills and availability. But I learned later that she had flagged my file, suggested I might be suited for something "challenging."

Pattern 7 was challenging. It was also, I would spend the next eight years learning, possibly impossible.

But I didn't know that then. I only knew that I had been chosen, singled out, given a signal that someone—maybe Maya herself—thought I could decode. It felt like a gift. It felt like trust.

I threw myself into the work. I forgot everything else—Daniel, my mother, the world outside the Chen Building. I became Pattern 7, and Pattern 7 became me.

Maya visited the lab once, in that first year. She came with her handlers, her camera crew, filming something for a documentary. She stopped at my desk—probably because someone had told her to, probably because my station was positioned well for the shot—and asked what I was working on.

I tried to explain. The hierarchical structures I was mapping, the recursive patterns that suggested grammar, the tantalizing almost-regularity that kept slipping away. I talked too fast, used too much jargon. I was nervous, which made me more technical, which made me less comprehensible.

She listened. She nodded. She asked a question—something simple, something a layperson would ask—and I answered it.

"It's like learning a language," she said, "where every word is in a code, and the code keeps changing."

It wasn't quite right, but it was close enough. "Something like that," I said.

"You'll crack it." She put her hand on my shoulder—brief, warm, the touch of a leader conveying confidence. "I can see it in how you talk about it. You already love it."

She was right. I did love it. Pattern 7 was mine, in a way nothing had ever been mine before.

"Thank you," I said.

She smiled, squeezed my shoulder, and moved on to the next desk. The camera followed. I went back to my screen.

Eight years later, I would destroy everything she had built. But in that moment, I was just a researcher, grateful to have been seen.

The sun is high now, the fog a memory. The bridge stands clear across the bay, red and solid, the kind of structure humans build when they want to connect two places that were never meant to touch.

I think about Maya, in whatever life she has now. Retired, probably. Emeritus. Giving interviews on anniversaries, consulting on documentaries, tending to the legacy she spent forty years constructing.

Does she think about me? Does she remember the quiet linguist on the fourth floor, the one she touched on the shoulder and told he would crack it?

Does she blame me?

I would understand if she did. I blamed myself for years—still do, in the hours before sleep, when the defenses come down. But blame requires a belief that things could have been different. That I could have found something else, or found nothing at all, or found the truth and kept it to myself.

I couldn't keep it to myself. That's not who I am. I spent my life chasing patterns, believing that patterns could be shared, that once you saw something true you could show it to others.

I was wrong about that, too.

---

Tomorrow I'll write about the signal itself. Pattern 7, my obsession, my life's work, my catastrophe. I'll try to explain what it looked like, what I saw in it, why I thought I could decode what no one else had decoded.

I'll try to explain, knowing already that explanation will fail. Because that's what I learned, in the end—that some truths resist transmission. That the most important things cannot be summarized, compressed, handed from one mind to another.

Maya built an empire on the assumption that the signals meant something we could understand. I proved that assumption wrong.

But she kept the empire. And I am here, in a converted garage, writing for no one.

That's not bitterness. It's just observation. She chose her path; I chose mine. She chose story; I chose truth.

I'm not sure, anymore, which of us was right.
