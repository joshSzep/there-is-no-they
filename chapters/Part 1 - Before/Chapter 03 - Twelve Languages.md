# Chapter 3: Twelve Languages

Polish, English, German, French, Russian, Latin, Ancient Greek, Mandarin, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese.

Thirteen, if you count the Japanese, though I never became fluent. Twelve and a half, maybe. Twelve and a quarter.

None of them helped.

I sit with that fact this morning, as the fog burns off and the bay emerges in fragments. I gave my life to languages. I believed, with the fervor of the converted, that words were bridges. That if I could just learn enough of them, in enough configurations, I could reach anyone.

The cosmic joke is this: I can order coffee in thirteen languages. I can discuss philosophy in eight. I can read poetry in six, make love in four, argue about politics in three.

And I could not explain to my husband what I had discovered. I could not explain it to my colleagues, or my director, or the committees that demanded explanations. I cannot explain it now to my mother, who is dying in a language I have spoken since birth and still cannot use to say the things that matter.

Languages are tools. I collected tools. I built a workshop full of them, organized and maintained and ready for use.

Then I encountered something that no tool could touch.

My father drank.

This is not a metaphor, not a euphemism. He drank vodka, mostly, the way other men breathed air. He drank in the morning, before work. He drank in the evening, after work. He drank on weekends, when there was no work to bracket the drinking, and the days became a single continuous pour.

I was seven when I understood that this was not normal. We were visiting my aunt—my mother's sister—in Gdańsk, and I watched my uncle drink a beer with dinner and then stop. Just stop. Put down the glass and talk and laugh and go to bed sober.

I remember thinking: you can do that?

My father could not do that. My father could not stop once he started, and he could not stop starting. He would make promises—to my mother, to me, to himself—and break them within hours. He would apologize, weep, swear that this time would be different. It was never different.

He was not a violent drunk. I want to be clear about that. He never hit my mother, never hit me. He was a quiet drunk, a disappearing drunk. The alcohol didn't make him angry; it made him absent. He would sit in his chair by the window, glass in hand, and slowly fade until only his body remained.

I learned early to read the signs. The heaviness in his eyes. The slight slur that crept into his consonants. The way his attention would drift mid-sentence, pulled by some internal current I couldn't see.

I learned to watch for patterns.

The phone rings.

I stare at it, heart pounding. Kraków. It must be Kraków. It must be the call I've been dreading, the one that will end the waiting and begin the grief.

I pick up.

"Mr. Kowalski?" A woman's voice, accented English. The caretaker. "I am calling with update."

"Yes."

"Your mother, she is same. She sleep most of time now. But she ask for you this morning. She ask when you coming."

I close my eyes. The bridge outside the window, solid and red. The fog, retreating.

"Soon," I say. "Tell her soon."

"I tell her. She will be happy."

I end the call. I sit with the lie, its weight familiar by now. Soon. I have been saying soon for three days. Soon is the word that lets me keep writing instead of packing.

Soon is the word that will haunt me when she dies.

My mother's silence was different from my father's.

His was absence—the evacuation of self that alcohol produced, the lights going out behind his eyes. Hers was presence. She was there, always there, watching and waiting and saying almost nothing.

I think now that she was conserving something. Marshaling her resources for the long campaign of keeping us alive while my father drank away his salary, his health, his future. She didn't have energy for unnecessary words. She spoke when speaking was required—directions, corrections, the logistics of daily life—and otherwise she watched.

I inherited her watchfulness. I did not inherit her silence.

Instead, I went the other way. I filled the quiet with languages. If my father had no words and my mother hoarded hers, I would have enough for all of us. I would learn every word in every language until the silence was finally, completely filled.

This is the psychology of it, anyway. The story I've told myself. I don't know if it's true. Maybe I just had an aptitude. Maybe the languages would have come regardless, pulled in by some neural quirk that had nothing to do with my father's drinking or my mother's reserve.

But I don't think so. I think I learned to speak because no one else would.

My father died when I was eleven.

Liver failure, the doctors said, as if we didn't know. As if the years of vodka were some medical mystery that required explanation. He went into the hospital and didn't come out. My mother took me to see him near the end, when he was yellow and swollen and no longer looked like himself.

"Tomek," he said. His voice was a whisper, ruined by the tube they'd put down his throat and then removed. "You're a good boy."

I didn't say anything. I stood by his bed and looked at this stranger who had been my father, and I couldn't find any words at all.

That night, at home, I took down the German dictionary my mother kept on the top shelf. I don't know why German—maybe because it was there, maybe because it looked difficult, maybe because I wanted something to fill the space where grief should have been.

I started memorizing. *Der, die, das.* The articles, the genders, the cases. I wrote them on index cards and tested myself until I could recite them without looking. Then I moved on to vocabulary. *Das Haus, der Baum, die Katze.* House, tree, cat. The building blocks of meaning.

My father died on a Thursday. By Sunday, I knew two hundred German words. By the end of the month, I could read simple sentences. By the end of the year, I was working through a German translation of *The Hobbit*, dictionary at my elbow, slowly converting the familiar story into a new shape.

My mother watched. She didn't comment, didn't encourage, didn't discourage. She simply watched, with that careful attention she gave to everything, and let me fill the silence however I needed to.

I should go. I should stop writing and go.

The flight is thirteen hours, with a connection in London or Frankfurt or Amsterdam. I could be there by tomorrow night. I could hold her hand. I could say whatever it is you're supposed to say to a dying mother.

But what would I say?

This is the question that keeps me at the desk. Not the logistics, not the expense, not the exhaustion of travel. The question of what words I would use when I got there.

I'm sorry? For what—for not coming sooner, for leaving in the first place, for becoming someone she never fully understood?

I love you? True, but insufficient. A phrase worn smooth by overuse, carrying almost no information.

Thank you? For raising me alone, for not falling apart when my father did, for the careful distance that let me become myself?

I have twelve languages. I have spent my life believing in the power of words. And I cannot find the words for this.

The languages came in waves.

German first, in the grief after my father. Then English, because it was required in school and I discovered I was good at it, better than my classmates, better than my teachers expected. By fifteen, I was reading English novels for pleasure—Orwell, Hemingway, the Americans with their short sentences and long silences.

French came next, because it was beautiful. I fell in love with the sounds before I understood the grammar, the way the syllables flowed into each other like water. I listened to French radio, French films, French songs I couldn't fully understand. Then I bought a grammar book and began to decode.

Russian was political, in a way. I was eighteen, the Wall had fallen, and suddenly the language of the occupier was just another language. I wanted to read Dostoevsky in the original, to see what had been lost in translation. (Everything, it turns out. Everything is always lost in translation. I didn't understand that yet.)

University gave me Latin and Greek—the dead languages, the roots. I loved their precision, their architecture. The way a Latin sentence could be rearranged without losing meaning, every word tagged with its grammatical function. A language like a machine, every part visible.

And then I discovered linguistics. Not languages themselves, but the study of language—the patterns beneath the patterns, the structures that all human communication shared. Suddenly my collection had a purpose. I wasn't just hoarding words; I was gathering data.

---

There's a theory in linguistics called Universal Grammar. The idea is that all human languages share a deep structure, a common blueprint hardwired into our brains. The surface differs—German puts the verb at the end, Japanese marks topics instead of subjects, Arabic builds words from three-consonant roots—but underneath, we're all speaking the same language.

I believed in this. I built my career on it. The search for universals, for the common ground beneath the babble of human speech.

The signals were supposed to be the ultimate test. If we could find structure in alien communication, it would prove that intelligence itself has a shape. That meaning, wherever it arises, follows patterns we can recognize and decode.

I was wrong.

Not about human languages—Universal Grammar may be real, or something like it. But I was wrong to think it would extend beyond our species. Wrong to think that the patterns I found in Mandarin and Arabic and Japanese would help me parse a signal from a star twenty-four hundred light-years away.

The universals I studied were human universals. They emerged from human brains, human bodies, human histories. They were deep, but they were not that deep.

There is no universal language. There is no grammar of the cosmos. There are only local agreements, temporary bridges, meaning that arises between specific minds in specific contexts and does not transfer.

I have twelve languages. Every one of them is a dialect of a single tongue: human. Outside that tongue, I am mute.

I moved to Berkeley in 2033 because I thought I had something to contribute.

This is embarrassing to admit now, but I was arrogant. Not in the way of boasting or self-promotion—I have never been good at those—but in the deeper way of believing I was special. I had twelve languages. I had a PhD in computational linguistics. I had published papers on pattern recognition in tonal systems, on the mathematical structure of Semitic roots, on the possibility of universal semantic primitives.

I thought this prepared me for the signals.

I was thirty-two years old. I had never failed at anything related to language. I had learned to read in a year what most people took five years to master. I had cracked grammatical codes that stumped my professors. I had a gift, and I was ready to use it.

The Chen Discovery had just happened. The signals were everywhere—in the news, in conversation, in the dreams of everyone who had ever looked up at the stars and wondered. And I was going to help decode them.

My mother drove me to the airport in Kraków. This was unusual—she didn't like to drive, and the airport was an hour away. But she insisted.

At the gate, she hugged me. This was also unusual. We were not a hugging family. Physical affection had always been sparse, rationed, as if there was a limited supply that had to be carefully managed.

"Tomek," she said, her arms around me. "Be careful with the words."

I didn't understand what she meant. I said something like "I will" or "I'll try," the automatic responses to a warning you don't quite hear.

I think about it now, that phrase. Be careful with the words. Was she warning me about the signals? About the hubris of thinking I could decode them? Or was she talking about something more personal—the words between people, the ones that could hurt without meaning to, the ones that could create distance even as they tried to close it?

I never asked. I got on the plane, and she drove home, and we continued our careful, long-distance relationship: weekly calls, occasional visits, love expressed in logistics rather than declarations.

I should have asked. I should have asked a lot of things.

The fog is gone now. The day is bright, the bay glittering, the bridge sharp against the sky.

I should call the airline. I should book a ticket. I should stop writing about the past and go home while I still can.

Instead, I open a new file. I start typing notes for the next chapter.

My mother said: be careful with the words.

I wasn't careful. I used words like tools, like weapons, like bridges I could throw across any gap. I believed in their power absolutely, the way my father believed in vodka, the way my mother believed in silence.

And like all absolute beliefs, mine was broken by something it couldn't accommodate. A signal from a star that didn't care about my languages. A pattern that refused to translate.

Tomorrow I'll write about Maya Chen. About the project, the institution, the edifice of hope we built on the assumption that meaning could always be extracted.

Tonight, I'll sit with my twelve languages and their uselessness. I'll think about my mother, in her apartment in Kraków, asking when I'm coming.

Soon, I told them. Tell her soon.

The word sits in my mouth like ash.
