# Chapter 5: Pattern 7

I still have the files.

This will sound strange—why would I keep them? What purpose could they serve now, twenty years later, the data that destroyed my career, my marriage, my place in the world?

But I keep them. On a drive in my desk drawer, backed up somewhere in the cloud, preserved like evidence from a crime scene. Sometimes, late at night, I open them and look at the visualizations. The spectrograms, the waveforms, the structural maps I spent eight years building. I stare at them the way you might stare at photographs of someone you loved who is now gone.

Pattern 7. My obsession. My life's work. My undoing.

Let me try to show you what I saw.

The phone again. I should stop flinching every time it rings.

This time it's a number I don't recognize—probably spam, probably nothing. I let it go to voicemail. If it's Kraków, they'll leave a message. If it's Kraków, I'll have to decide what to do.

The sun is angling through the window now, late afternoon light that turns everything golden. My mother loved this time of day. "Złota godzina," she called it—the golden hour. She would stop whatever she was doing and stand at the window, watching the light change.

I wonder if she still does that. I wonder if she can still stand.

I should call. I should ask.

Instead, I open the old files. Instead, I return to Pattern 7.

A signal from space is not what you imagine.

You imagine something clean—a message, a broadcast, a voice from the stars. You imagine decoding it like a telegram, like a letter from a distant relative, like anything humans have ever sent to each other.

But Pattern 7 wasn't like that. Pattern 7 was noise that contained structure—or structure that looked like noise, depending on how you squinted. It was a torrent of electromagnetic radiation, captured by radio telescopes over decades, compressed into data files, rendered on my screen as colors and shapes that my brain struggled to interpret.

On a spectrogram, it looked like mountains. I said that before. But let me be more precise.

Imagine a landscape of peaks and valleys, frequencies stacked on top of each other, each point colored by intensity. Now imagine that landscape moving, evolving, the peaks rising and falling in patterns that almost repeat but never quite do. Now imagine that the landscape is layered—signals on top of signals, like voices talking over each other at a party, and you're trying to isolate just one conversation.

That was Pattern 7. One voice in a cacophony, separated out by algorithms and human patience, rendered visible on my screen.

And somewhere in that shifting landscape, I believed, was meaning.

---

The first year was mapping.

I didn't try to decode anything. I just looked. Catalogued. Marked the features that repeated, the structures that seemed intentional, the boundaries between segments. I treated it like an archaeological site, documenting what was there before trying to understand what it meant.

This is how I work—slowly, methodically, building a foundation before I attempt a structure. It's not dramatic. It doesn't make for good stories. But it's the only way I know how to approach something truly unknown.

Yusuf thought I was too slow. "You've been staring at the same data for six months," he said once, leaning over from his desk. "Aren't you going to try something?"

"I am trying something," I said. "I'm trying to see it."

He laughed, not unkindly. "You're going to stare that signal into submission?"

"Maybe."

He shook his head and went back to his own work. Yusuf was working on Pattern 15, a simpler signal with more obvious structure. He was making faster progress, publishing preliminary papers, earning attention. I was still mapping.

But I was seeing things. The more I looked, the more the signal revealed. Recurring motifs that appeared at irregular intervals. Hierarchical structures—smaller patterns nested inside larger ones, like sentences inside paragraphs inside chapters. Boundary markers that seemed to indicate the beginning and end of... something.

I couldn't prove any of this yet. I couldn't show that the patterns were intentional rather than coincidental, meaningful rather than noise. But I could feel it—the shape of something underneath, the skeleton waiting to be uncovered.

---

The second year was hypothesis.

I started building models—mathematical descriptions of what the signal might be doing. If this is grammar, what are the rules? If these are words, how do they combine? If this is meaning, how is it encoded?

Most models failed immediately. The signal didn't behave the way they predicted. I would build a framework, test it against the data, watch it collapse.

This is normal. This is science. You try things, they don't work, you try something else.

But it's also exhausting. Every failure felt personal, a referendum on my abilities, my approach, my worthiness. I had been chosen for this. I was supposed to be good at this. And model after model crumbled into nothing.

Daniel saw me through it. He didn't understand the specifics—I couldn't explain them in ways that made sense to a non-specialist—but he understood the rhythm. Good days and bad days, hope and disappointment, the long slog of work that might never pay off.

"You'll figure it out," he said, again and again. "You always do."

I clung to that faith. Some nights, it was the only thing that got me back to the desk in the morning.

The third year, the fourth, the fifth. Time blurs.

I remember progress in fragments. A model that held up for three weeks before failing on new data. A structural feature I discovered that no one else had noticed. A paper I published—cautious, preliminary—that got cited a dozen times.

I remember setbacks more clearly. The six months I spent pursuing a dead end, convinced I had found the key, only to realize I had been fooling myself. The departmental review where I had to justify my slow progress, explaining to administrators why eight years on a single signal was not a waste of resources.

I remember Daniel, patient through all of it. The dinners where I was distracted. The weekends I spent at the office. The conversations where he asked what I was thinking and I said "Pattern 7" and he smiled and didn't press further.

He deserved more. I knew that even then. I knew I was giving everything to the signal and leaving scraps for my marriage. But I told myself it was temporary. I told myself that once I cracked it, once I found what I was looking for, I would come back to him fully.

The lie we tell ourselves: there will be time later.

Let me describe what I came to see.

Pattern 7, over eight years of mapping and modeling, revealed itself to be hierarchical. Like a language, it had levels—small units combining into larger units, larger units combining into larger still. I called them, for lack of better terms, phonemes and morphemes and phrases, though I knew these human labels didn't capture what they actually were.

The smallest units were simple: bursts of activity at specific frequencies, lasting milliseconds. These combined, by rules I gradually uncovered, into more complex structures—clusters of bursts that repeated with variations, like words with prefixes and suffixes.

The clusters combined into sequences. The sequences combined into larger blocks. The blocks combined into... I never found the end of the hierarchy. Every level I uncovered seemed to contain another level above it.

And the rules. The beautiful, maddening rules.

Some combinations were common; others never appeared. Some sequences predicted what came next; others were unique, appearing only once in the entire dataset. There was structure—deep, consistent, undeniable structure—and the structure had the feeling of intention.

Not human intention. Not anything I could anthropomorphize. But intention nonetheless—the sense that these patterns existed because something had created them, had organized them, had meant something by them.

By year seven, I had a model. Not a translation—I never believed in translation—but a grammar. A set of rules that described how the signal was organized, that could predict with reasonable accuracy what would come next in a sequence.

It wasn't perfect. The predictions failed sometimes, and I didn't understand why. But it was working. After seven years of failure, something was finally working.

I stop typing. The golden hour is fading, the light going grey.

My mother, in Kraków, in the apartment where I grew up. Is she watching the light change? Is she thinking about me, wondering when I'm coming?

I think about Pattern 7, about the years I gave it. I think about what I found, and what I thought I had found, and how different those two things turned out to be.

I was so close. So close to what I believed was understanding. And I was so completely wrong about what understanding meant.

---

Year eight.

The model improved. The predictions got better. I refined and tested, tested and refined, the way you polish something until it shines.

I started to believe I had done it. Not consciously—I was too careful for that, too aware of how many times I had been wrong before. But in the quiet of my mind, in the place where hope lives before you admit it to yourself, I started to believe.

I imagined the announcement. The paper in Nature. Maya's face when I told her. Daniel's arms around me, his voice saying "I knew you would."

I imagined being the one who cracked it. The first person in history to decode an alien signal. Not Maya, with her accidental discovery—but me, with my eight years of labor, my patient mapping, my twelve languages that had trained me to see patterns others couldn't see.

It was hubris. I know that now. But at the time, it felt like hope.

---

The night it worked.

I'll write more about this later—it deserves its own chapter, its own careful attention. But let me tell you how it felt.

Late spring, 2043. I was alone in the lab, as I often was. The building was quiet, the cleaning crew gone, only the hum of servers and the glow of my screens.

I ran the model on a new segment of data—fresh material I hadn't tested before. This was the real test: not fitting the model to data I already knew, but predicting data I had never seen.

The output appeared on my screen. I compared it to the actual signal.

It matched.

Not perfectly—there were small discrepancies, noise at the edges. But the structure matched. The hierarchy matched. The patterns I had mapped, the rules I had uncovered—they worked. They predicted something real.

I sat very still. I didn't breathe.

Then I ran it again, on another segment. It worked.

Again. It worked.

I ran it a dozen times, on every piece of data I could find that I hadn't used in building the model. It worked. It kept working.

I understood something. Not everything—not the meaning, not the semantics, not what the signal was about. But the structure. The grammar. The rules that governed how it was organized.

After eight years, I had cracked Pattern 7.

---

I should have stopped there.

I should have documented what I found, written it up, submitted it for review. I should have let others verify, critique, improve. I should have been a scientist—cautious, methodical, humble in the face of discovery.

Instead, I did what any scientist would do. I tested my model on something new.

Pattern 12 was sitting right there, in the database, a signal from the same region of sky as Pattern 7. The project's working hypothesis was that nearby signals might be related—different transmissions from the same source, or different sources with a common origin. If my model worked on Pattern 7, it might work on Pattern 12.

It was a reasonable assumption. It was the assumption everyone made.

I opened Pattern 12. I ran my model.

And everything fell apart.

But that's the next chapter. The fog is coming back, or maybe it's dusk, or maybe my eyes are just tired. I've been writing for hours.

Tomorrow I'll tell you about the night everything changed. The triumph and the collapse, separated by less than an hour. The slack jaw, the silence, the beginning of the end.

Tonight I'll sit with the memory of what it felt like to believe I had succeeded. That brief window—minutes, maybe thirty of them—when I thought I had decoded an alien signal.

It was the happiest I have ever been.

I didn't know, in those thirty minutes, that the happiness was already ash. That the model that worked so beautifully on Pattern 7 would produce fluent, confident, coherent nonsense on Pattern 12. That I was about to discover something true, and the truth would destroy everything I had built.

The golden hour is gone. The room is grey. My mother is dying on the other side of the world.

Tomorrow, I'll tell you how it ended.
