# Chapter 1: The Fog

The fog is coming in.

I watch it from the window of this room I did not expect to inhabit. Sixty-two years old, alone, in a city that has changed around me while I stayed still. The bay is disappearing. The bridge will follow—first the towers, then the cables, then nothing but white where the span should be.

My mother is dying in Kraków. I am here, writing.

I should explain why I'm not on a plane. I should explain why I'm at this desk instead of at her bedside, holding her hand while she slips away. I have twelve languages. I've spent my life believing that with enough words, arranged carefully enough, anything could be made clear.

I don't know how to explain this.

So I'll write around it. I'll write about what happened twenty years ago—the thing that made me the man I am, sitting here, watching the fog erase the world outside my window while my mother dies six thousand miles away. Maybe by the time I reach the end, I'll understand why I'm not there.

Maybe.

The desk is old. Oak, I think, though I've never been sure. I bought it at an estate sale fifteen years ago, when I still thought I might write something. It sat empty for a decade. Now it holds a laptop, a cold cup of coffee, and whatever this is becoming.

The room is small. A converted garage behind a house I rent from people I've never met—they live in Seattle, I send them money, they leave me alone. One window facing west. A bed I make every morning because the discipline feels like proof I'm still here. Books I no longer read. A photograph of my parents on their wedding day, my father young and sober, my mother's smile unguarded in a way I rarely saw.

She called three days ago. Or her caretaker did, using her phone, with her in the background. "Tomek," she said when they put her on, and for a moment she sounded like herself. Then: "When are you coming?"

I said something. I don't remember what. Something about soon. Something about arrangements.

I haven't made any arrangements.

I open a blank document. The cursor blinks. Outside, the fog continues its slow erasure.

Let me tell you about the day before everything changed.

---

In the spring of 2043, I was forty-two years old and I had been working on Pattern 7 for eight years.

Eight years. I want you to understand what that means. Not eight years of dramatic breakthroughs and crushing setbacks, not eight years of racing against rivals and fighting for funding. Eight years of sitting at a desk not unlike this one, staring at representations of something no human had ever seen before, trying to find the shape of meaning in noise.

Most days, nothing happened. I would run a model, examine the output, adjust a parameter, run it again. The work was painstaking in the literal sense: it caused pain, and I took pains over it. I would go home in the evening having moved some needle some imperceptible distance, and I would come back the next morning and do it again.

Daniel used to ask how I could stand it. "Doesn't it drive you crazy?" he said once, early on, when we were still learning each other's rhythms. "The same thing, day after day, and nothing to show for it?"

I remember the conversation. We were in the kitchen of the house we shared, the house I would eventually leave, the house I don't know if he still lives in. He was making dinner—pasta, I think, or maybe stir-fry, something with garlic—and I was sitting at the counter with a glass of wine, watching him move.

"It's not nothing," I said. "It's just slow."

"But how do you know you're making progress? How do you know you're not just—" He waved the spatula, searching for words. "Rearranging deck chairs?"

"I don't," I said. "I won't know until it works. Or doesn't."

He looked at me then, and I saw something in his face I didn't fully understand at the time. Concern, yes. But also something like awe, or maybe fear. The look you give someone who is capable of a patience you cannot imagine.

"I couldn't do it," he said.

"You do it with me," I said.

He laughed. "That's different."

It wasn't different. It was the same thing. Love and translation—both require you to believe that the gap can be crossed, even when you can't see the other side.

The Chen Building sat at the edge of campus, a glass-and-steel monument to the discovery that had changed everything. Maya's face was not literally on the building, but it might as well have been. Every display in the lobby, every plaque on every wall, every documentary playing on silent loop for visitors—they all told the same story. The woman who heard the universe.

I walked past her portrait every morning for ten years. We were the same age, Maya and I. We had started from roughly the same place—graduate students with unusual skills, drawn to the impossible problem of alien communication. But she had stumbled onto something, and I had not. She had become the face of human hope, and I had become one of the workers in the building that bore her name.

I don't say this with bitterness. Or if I do, it's an old bitterness, worn smooth by time. Maya earned what she got. Her mistake was fortunate, but she had the intelligence to recognize it and the charisma to explain it. I had neither. I had only patience, and precision, and the stubborn belief that if I kept working, something would eventually yield.

That spring morning in 2043, I walked past her portrait and felt nothing but the usual dull acknowledgment. I took the elevator to the fourth floor. I nodded at Yusuf, who was already at his desk, squinting at something on his screen. I sat down at my workstation and opened the files I had been staring at for eight years.

Pattern 7.

---

Let me try to describe what it looked like, though I know already that the description will fail.

Imagine a sound. Not a sound you've heard, but a sound that has traveled for three thousand years across twenty-four hundred light-years of empty space. A sound that was never meant for human ears, that was not a sound at all but a pattern of electromagnetic radiation, a ripple in the fabric of the universe that we learned to capture and convert and display.

On my screen, it looked like mountains. That's the wrong word, but it's the only one I have. A spectrogram: frequency on one axis, time on the other, amplitude rendered in color. Blues and greens where the signal was weak, yellows and oranges where it grew stronger, deep reds at the peaks. A landscape of noise that was not noise.

I had been staring at this landscape for eight years. I knew its terrain the way you know the drive to work, the way you know your own face in the mirror. Every ridge and valley, every repeating structure, every anomaly I had flagged and examined and cross-referenced with everything else.

And somewhere in that landscape, I believed, was meaning.

Not meaning in the human sense. I wasn't looking for words, or stories, or emotions. I was looking for structure—the underlying logic that organized the signal, the rules that governed what came next. Grammar, in the most abstract sense. The skeleton beneath the skin.

If I could find that, I thought, the rest would follow. Not translation—I never believed in translation, not really, not the clean conversion of one set of symbols into another. But *understanding*. The recognition that a pattern was a pattern, that a structure was doing something, that behind the noise was intention.

That morning, I ran a model I had been refining for three months. A small adjustment to a parameter, a slight change in how the algorithm weighted certain features. Incremental. Painstaking.

The output appeared on my screen. I examined it. The fit was marginally better—a 0.3% improvement in predictive accuracy.

I noted the result in my log. I adjusted another parameter. I ran the model again.

This was the work. This was every day.

The fog has thickened. I can no longer see the bridge at all.

I should call someone. The caretaker, or the hospice, or whatever system of strangers is currently keeping my mother alive in her apartment in Kraków. I should ask how she is. I should tell them I'm coming.

I pick up my phone. I put it down.

I don't know how to explain what I'm doing. I'm writing a book that no one asked for, about events that the world has mostly forgotten, instead of flying home to say goodbye to my mother. The man who broke the Signal Translation Project, they called me. The man who couldn't explain what he found. And now I'm trying to explain it again, two decades later, to no one in particular, while the woman who raised me dies alone.

This is who I am. This is who I became.

The cursor blinks. The fog erases. I keep writing.

That afternoon, I took a walk.

This was unusual. I was not a man who took walks in the middle of the workday. But something about the light, or the stiffness in my back, or the marginal improvement that felt like nothing at all—something made me stand up from my desk and leave the building.

The campus was beautiful in April. I forget this sometimes, when I remember only the work, only the screens, only the patterns that consumed my waking hours. But Berkeley in spring was extravagant with blossoms. The hills were green from the winter rains. Students sat on the lawns, studying or pretending to study, living the lives that students live.

I walked past them and felt old. Forty-two was not old, not really, but in that moment, surrounded by youth, I felt the weight of the years I had given to a problem that might never be solved.

I had come to Berkeley for this. I had left Poland, left Europe, left everything familiar, because I believed that here, in this building, with these people, I might be part of something that mattered. Humanity's first conversation with another intelligence. The end of our cosmic loneliness.

Eleven years later, we had hundreds of distinct patterns isolated from the background. We had thousands of papers analyzing those patterns. We had conferences and journals and entire careers built on the assumption that the signals meant something, that they could be understood, that it was only a matter of time.

But no one had decoded a single one.

I sat down on a bench beneath a flowering tree. I don't know what kind—I never learned the names of California plants. The blossoms were white, tinged with pink. Petals drifted down in the breeze.

I thought about Daniel, at home, doing whatever he did on his days at the office. Managing grants, coordinating budgets, the administrative machinery that kept projects like mine funded. He believed in the work even when I didn't. Or maybe he believed in me, which was different and harder.

I thought about my mother, in Kraków, in the apartment where I grew up, with its narrow kitchen and the window that looked out onto the courtyard. She would be making tea at this hour. She would be listening to the radio, or reading, or staring out that window at a view she had known for fifty years.

I had not been home in three years. I kept meaning to go. There was always another paper to write, another model to run, another reason to delay. She never complained. She understood, or said she understood, or pretended to understand. The work was important. I was doing important things.

I watched the petals fall. I thought: I should go home.

I didn't know then that I was running out of time. How could I? She was healthy, or healthy enough. She was seventy-three years old and still sharp, still independent, still the woman who had raised me alone after my father drowned himself in vodka.

I should have gone then. That spring, when the blossoms were falling and the work was going nowhere and I had all the time in the world.

I didn't.

---

The fog is absolute now. The window shows nothing but white.

I should stop. I should sleep. I should call the hospice and ask if she's still conscious, if there's still time, if she's asked for me.

Instead, I write. I write about the day before everything changed, when I sat on a bench beneath a tree whose name I never learned and felt the weight of years I thought I would have forever.

I write because it's the only thing I know how to do.

In the morning, I'll write more. I'll tell you about Pattern 7, about the model that finally worked, about the triumph that lasted less than a day before it turned to ash. I'll tell you about what I found, and what I lost, and why I'm sitting in this room in Berkeley instead of flying home to say goodbye.

I'll tell you, because I can't tell her. Because I never could explain it, not to her, not to Daniel, not to anyone. Because the thing I discovered was that some things cannot be explained.

But I have to try.

The fog outside my window. The fog inside my head. The fog that has been with me for twenty years, ever since I saw something true and couldn't make anyone understand.

Tomorrow, I'll try again.

Tonight, I watch the white.
