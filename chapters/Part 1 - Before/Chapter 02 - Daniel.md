# Chapter 2: Daniel

I wonder if he knows I'm writing this.

It's possible. We have mutual friends, or we did, though I've let most of those connections wither over the years. Someone might have mentioned it. "Did you hear Tom is writing a book?" The kind of thing that gets passed along at parties, in that careful tone people use when discussing exes. Curious, neutral, studiously uninvested.

Or maybe no one knows. Maybe I've become invisible enough that my actions no longer ripple outward. A man in a converted garage, typing into the fog.

I don't know where Daniel is. I could find out—it would take thirty seconds, a name in a search field, the ordinary machinery of connection that everyone uses now. But I haven't looked. Not in years. There's a kind of discipline in not knowing, a penance or a protection, I'm not sure which.

He would be fifty-eight now. Still young, by the standards of this stretched-out century. Probably still handsome—he had the kind of face that would age well, the lines settling into character rather than decay. Probably still warm, still quick to laugh, still the person who remembered birthdays and kept friendships alive.

Probably with someone else. Probably happy, or happy enough.

I hope he's happy. I want that to be true. I'm not sure I've earned the right to want anything about him, but I want that anyway.

The fog thinned overnight but hasn't lifted. The bridge is visible now, a ghost of itself, the cables appearing and disappearing as the white drifts past. I've made coffee. I've checked my phone—no messages from Kraków, which means nothing has changed, which means I have more time, which means I can keep writing instead of booking a flight.

The logic is circular and I know it. But I keep following it around.

Let me tell you about Daniel.

---

We met in 2033, the year after the Chen Discovery, when the world was still reeling and the project was still new.

I had been in Berkeley for three months. I was thirty-two years old, fluent in eleven languages, and utterly lost. Not geographically—I could navigate the campus, the city, the BART system that carried me to San Francisco when I needed to feel anonymous. Lost in the other sense. The sense of not knowing what my life was for.

I had come for the signals. Everyone had, that year—linguists and mathematicians and physicists and philosophers, anyone who thought they might have something to contribute to the great work of decoding. The project was hiring aggressively, building teams, absorbing talent from around the world. I was one of hundreds.

But the work hadn't started yet, not really. We were still organizing, still building infrastructure, still arguing about methodology. I spent my days in meetings and my evenings alone in a small apartment near the campus, cooking simple meals and reading papers and wondering if I had made a mistake.

Daniel was a mistake. Or he felt like one, at first.

I met him at a reception for new staff. One of those events with bad wine and forced conversation, everyone wearing name tags, everyone asking "What do you do?" and "Where are you from?" and listening to the answers just long enough to formulate their own response.

He was standing by the window, looking out at the bay. I noticed him because he wasn't talking to anyone—unusual, at these things. And because he was beautiful, though I wouldn't have used that word at the time. I would have said "attractive" or "striking" or some other word that kept a safe distance.

I walked over. I don't know why. I was not a man who walked over to strangers at parties. But something about his stillness, his separateness, drew me.

"The view is better from the roof," I said. An absurd opening. I had no idea if there was roof access, or what the view from it would be.

He turned. Brown eyes, a quick smile that reached them. "Is that an invitation?"

"I don't know," I said. "I just got here. I have no idea how anything works."

He laughed. "Join the club." He extended his hand. "Daniel. Grant administration. I make sure people like you get paid."

"Tomasz. Linguistics. I make sure—" I stopped. "I don't actually know what I make sure of yet."

"Tomasz," he repeated, testing the syllables. Most Americans stumbled on my name, Anglicized it, asked for a nickname. He didn't. "Polish?"

"Yes."

"How many languages do you speak?"

"Eleven."

His eyebrows rose. "Eleven?"

"It's less impressive than it sounds. Most of them are related. If you speak one Romance language, the others come easily."

"I speak one language," he said. "Badly."

"English isn't a bad language."

"I didn't say English. I said I speak one language badly. There's a difference."

I laughed. It surprised me—I hadn't laughed in weeks.

We talked for an hour. Then we left the reception and found a bar and talked for three more hours. Then he walked me back to my apartment and kissed me on the doorstep and I stood there after he left, touching my lips like a teenager, wondering what had just happened.

---

I should explain something about myself at thirty-two. I was not, by any standard, a person who fell easily.

I had had relationships—brief ones, in Poland and Germany and the UK, the kind of connections you make in graduate school and let dissolve when the program ends. I had slept with men, occasionally women, without feeling that the sleeping meant anything beyond the moment. I had convinced myself that this was maturity: the ability to connect without attaching, to enjoy without needing.

But I had never been in love. Not really. Not the kind that reaches into your chest and rearranges things.

Daniel rearranged things.

Within a month, we were spending every night together. Within three months, he had moved into my apartment—or I had moved into his, I don't remember which came first, just the gradual accumulation of shared space. His books on my shelves. My coffee maker on his counter. The negotiation of closet space and bathroom schedules and who got which side of the bed.

It was terrifying. It was also the easiest thing I had ever done.

---

I stop typing. The coffee has gone cold.

Somewhere in this city, or another city, or another country, Daniel exists. He wakes up in a bed, alone or not alone. He drinks his coffee—he always took it with too much sugar, a habit I teased him about, a sweetness I pretended to disapprove of. He goes through his day, doing whatever he does now, being whoever he has become.

Does he think about me? On ordinary mornings, when nothing particular triggers the memory? Or have I faded into the background of his life, a chapter that ended, a story he tells at dinner parties: "I was married once, to a scientist. It didn't work out."

I have no right to hope he still thinks of me. I have no right to hope for anything.

But I think about him. Every day. Every morning when I make coffee and add no sugar. Every evening when I sit alone in this room that used to be a garage and listen to the silence where another person should be.

---

In 2043, we had been together for ten years.

I want to describe what that felt like, but I don't have the words. This is ironic—I am supposed to be good with words, I have made a career of them, I speak twelve languages now and none of them can capture what it meant to share a decade with another person.

The house. We had bought it in 2037, a small Craftsman bungalow in the hills, too expensive even then, worth three times as much now if I cared to sell it. Which I don't. Daniel got it in the divorce, such as it was—we weren't legally married until 2036, and by then the assets were too tangled to separate cleanly, so we just agreed that he would keep the house and I would keep my retirement accounts and we would call it even.

I don't know if he still lives there. I told you: I don't look.

But in 2043, the house was ours. The garden Daniel planted, tomatoes and peppers and herbs I couldn't name. The kitchen where he cooked and I cleaned, our bodies moving around each other in the practiced choreography of long partnership. The bedroom with the window that faced east, where we woke together to the morning light.

I am not a sentimental man. I have never been one for nostalgia, for dwelling in the past. But sitting here now, in this room that is not our room, I find myself missing things I hadn't thought about in years.

The way he hummed when he cooked. Never a tune I recognized, just this low, unconscious music that meant he was content.

The way he read with his whole body, curled into the corner of the couch, so absorbed that he wouldn't hear me if I spoke.

The way he touched me—casually, constantly, a hand on my shoulder as he passed, fingers brushing mine when he handed me something. As if he needed to keep confirming I was there.

I was there. I was there for ten years. And then I wasn't, and it was my fault, and I don't know how to write about that yet.

---

Let me stay in 2043 a little longer. Let me describe the marriage before I describe its end.

Daniel worked in grant administration for the project. This sounds dull, and in some ways it was—budgets and compliance and the endless paperwork of institutional science. But he was good at it, and more than that, he believed in it. He believed that the work we were doing mattered, that the signals meant something, that one day we would understand.

He had no scientific training. He had studied English literature in college, drifted into administration because it paid better than adjuncting, ended up at Berkeley because a friend told him they were hiring. He had no particular investment in linguistics or astrophysics or any of the technical disciplines that consumed the rest of us.

But he believed. That was his gift, maybe—the capacity to believe in things he didn't fully understand. To trust that the people who understood would eventually make sense of it all.

"You'll figure it out," he used to say when I came home frustrated, when another model had failed, when another year had passed with nothing to show. "You always do."

I loved him for that faith. I also feared it. Because I knew, even then, that I might not figure it out. That I might spend my entire life staring at patterns that refused to resolve. That his faith might be misplaced, and I would be the one who proved it.

---

We had rituals. This is what ten years gives you: rituals.

Saturday mornings, we went to the farmers' market in North Berkeley. Daniel chose the vegetables; I carried the bags. We would stop at the coffee stand and argue about whether their espresso was better than the place down the street, the same argument every week, neither of us ever conceding.

Sunday evenings, we cooked together. Not the weeknight cooking, which was hurried and practical—this was slow cooking, a project, something we built together. Risotto, stirred for forty-five minutes. Braised short ribs, falling off the bone. Bread, when we were feeling ambitious, though it never rose the way the recipes promised.

We read to each other sometimes. This sounds antiquated, I know, in an age of infinite entertainment, but Daniel loved it. He would find a passage—a poem, a paragraph, sometimes a whole chapter—and read it aloud while I lay with my head in his lap. His voice was different when he read: slower, more careful, as if each word deserved its own space.

I miss that. I miss lying in the late afternoon light, listening to his voice, letting meaning wash over me without having to parse it.

---

The fog is lifting. The bridge is almost clear now, the red towers vivid against the grey, the cables sharp. I should take this as a sign. I should book a flight, pack a bag, go to the airport. I should stop writing about the past and tend to the present.

My phone sits on the desk. I don't pick it up.

---

In 2043, I didn't know I was about to destroy everything.

That sounds dramatic. It wasn't dramatic, not at first. The destruction was slow, quiet, a hairline fracture that spread over months. But it began that spring, in the weeks before the breakthrough, when I was still a man with a marriage and a career and a mother who called every Sunday.

Daniel could tell something was different. He always could—he read me better than I read myself, which was frustrating and also a relief. "You're somewhere else," he said one evening, when I had been staring at my plate without eating.

"I'm here," I said.

"Your body is here. You're somewhere else."

He wasn't wrong. I was thinking about Pattern 7. I was always thinking about Pattern 7. But that spring, the thinking had a different quality—an intensity, a focus that pushed everything else to the margins.

"I think I'm close," I said.

He set down his fork. "Close to what?"

"I don't know. Something. The model is behaving differently. The fit is improving. It's small, but it's consistent, and I've never seen consistency like this before."

"Tom." He reached across the table and took my hand. "That's wonderful."

"It might be nothing."

"It might not be."

I looked at him—really looked, for the first time in days. His face was open, hopeful. He believed in me. He always believed in me.

"I need to focus," I said. "For the next few weeks. I need to—"

"Go," he said. "Focus. I'll be here."

He squeezed my hand. He smiled. He believed that this was temporary, that I would focus and succeed or focus and fail and either way I would come back to him.

He was half right.

---

I want to stop here. I want to stay in this moment, before the fall—Daniel across the table, his hand in mine, the future still open.

But the fog is lifting and my mother is dying and I have to keep writing.

Tomorrow I'll tell you about my languages. About Poland, and my father, and the silence that taught me to listen for patterns. About the boy I was before I became the man who broke everything.

Tonight, I'll sit with the ghost of the marriage. I'll remember what it felt like to be known, to be held, to be believed in.

I'll try not to think about how thoroughly I betrayed all of it.
