# Chapter 25: The Song

This is the last chapter.

I've been sitting here for an hour, not writing, just looking at the fog. It's thick today—the thickest it's been in weeks. The world ends at the edge of the garage, grey and formless, and I am alone with the blinking cursor and the question of how to end.

A memoir should have an ending. A shape, a conclusion, a final note that makes sense of everything that came before. But lives don't end that way—they just stop. And this memoir is not about my ending. I'm still here, still alive, still waiting for whatever comes next.

So what do I write? What do I say to close a book about the impossibility of saying things?

---

Let me start with what I know.

The signals are real. They come from minds we cannot comprehend, carrying meanings we cannot decode. They are songs, sung into the void, reaching across distances that make our lives seem small.

They will never be translated. The gap between minds—between human minds and alien minds, between any mind and any other—is real and unbridgeable. We can build approximations, imperfect bridges, structures of language that carry some weight. But the full transmission of experience from one consciousness to another is impossible. It has always been impossible. It will always be impossible.

This is not a tragedy. Or rather, it is not only a tragedy.

The same gap that isolates us also individuates us. The same unbridgeable distance that makes perfect understanding impossible also makes each mind unique, each perspective unrepeatable, each experience singular. We are alone because we are ourselves. The price of being is solitude.

And yet we sing anyway.

---

I think about the minds that sent the signals.

I don't know what they were. I don't know if they had bodies, emotions, anything we would recognize as life. But I know they made something. They took whatever they experienced and they shaped it into patterns, into information, into signals that would outlast them by millennia.

They must have known, on some level, that their songs might never be heard. The distances involved are staggering; the probability of reception is vanishingly small. And yet they sang. They offered their existence to the cosmos, without guarantee, without expectation, simply because offering was what they could do.

This is what I've learned, in twenty years of living with this knowledge: the offering is the point. Not the reception, not the understanding, not the bridge successfully built. The offering itself—the act of reaching, the gesture toward connection—that's what matters.

My mother understood this. She told me, in her last days, about my father singing in the garden. He sang for himself, she said. Not for an audience. Just for the joy of it.

Maybe that's all any of us are doing. Singing for the joy of it. Reaching toward each other because reaching is our nature, because we cannot help ourselves, because the alternative—silence, isolation, the refusal to try—is worse than failure.

---

I want to tell you what this memoir is.

It's not a translation of my experience. I've tried, in these pages, to convey what I saw that night in the lab, what it felt like to understand the gap. But I know I've failed. The words create a picture, and the picture is wrong—not because I lied, but because words always create wrong pictures. That's their nature.

What you have, reading this, is not my experience. It's a set of symbols, patterns, signals that your mind will interpret according to its own structures, its own history, its own unbridgeable uniqueness. You will understand something—some version, some approximation—and it will not be what I meant.

That's okay. That's all communication ever is. We send signals; they are received and transformed; something passes between us, even if it's not the something we intended.

This memoir is a song. My song, offered to the void, hoping for resonance but not requiring it.

---

I think about Daniel.

He's out there somewhere, living his life. Married again, happy, I hope. He built the bridges I couldn't build. He found someone who could meet him in the space between, who could do the work of connection that I was too broken to do.

I don't regret him. I regret my failures, the distance I created, the years of silence that could have been years of imperfect communication. But I don't regret loving him, or trying, or failing.

The failure was honest. The reaching was real. And somewhere, in the space between our islands, something existed—love, or its approximation, or something we don't have a word for. Something that mattered, even though it wasn't enough.

---

I think about my mother.

She's gone now. Her body is in the ground in Kraków, next to my father, in the cemetery where I stood three weeks ago. She can't hear me anymore—couldn't hear me even when she was alive, not really, not across the gap of language and generation and distance.

But I sang to her anyway, that last night. I told her everything I had never told her, knowing the words couldn't bridge the gap, offering them anyway.

And something happened. Not understanding—she was beyond understanding by then. But something. A presence. A reaching.

Maybe that's what I mean by grace. Not the miraculous bridging of unbridgeable gaps, but the presence that persists despite the gap. The love that reaches even when it can't arrive.

---

I think about the future.

I'm sixty-two years old. I have some years left—how many, I don't know. I'll keep teaching at the community college, keep walking the hills above the bay, keep writing things that no one may ever read.

The signals will keep singing. New ones are being discovered all the time, by the small teams that still listen, the hobbyists and the dedicated few who haven't given up. The catalog grows; the silence of each signal remains unbroken; the songs accumulate.

Someday—a thousand years from now, ten thousand—maybe someone will find a way. Maybe some future mind, human or machine or something we can't imagine, will build a bridge I couldn't build. Will decode the signals, translate the songs, prove that the gap can be crossed after all.

I don't think so. I think the gap is fundamental, structural, woven into the nature of mind itself. But I've been wrong before.

And even if I'm right—even if the gap is eternal—the singing will continue. Because that's what minds do. That's what existence is: a song, sung into the void, hoping for resonance, beautiful regardless of reception.

Let me tell you how this morning began.

I woke at dawn. The fog was thick, as it is now, pressing against the windows, erasing the world. I made coffee. I sat at my desk. I opened this document and stared at the blinking cursor.

And then I heard something.

It wasn't a signal—not the kind from the cosmos, not the kind that requires radio telescopes and computational filtering. It was simpler than that. A bird, singing outside the window. A small thing, invisible in the fog, offering its song to the grey morning.

I listened. The bird didn't know I was listening, didn't care. It sang because singing was its nature, because the morning had arrived, because existence demanded expression.

I thought: *This is it. This is the whole story.*

A mind, singing. A listener, receiving. The gap between them, unbridgeable. And yet the singing continues, and the listening continues, and something passes through the fog, imperfect and transformed but real.

---

I don't have a conclusion.

I don't have a final truth, a neat resolution, a lesson that makes sense of everything. I have only this: I am here. I have lived. I have seen things that changed me, and I have tried to put those things into words, and the words have failed, and I have written them anyway.

The signals are singing. The bird is singing. I am singing, in my way, with these words that will reach you, transformed, across the gap.

I don't know if you understand. I don't know if understanding is possible.

But I know that you are there, somewhere, reading this. And I am here, writing it. And between us, something passes. Something imperfect, inadequate, transformed by your own mind into something I didn't intend.

That something is enough. It has to be enough.

Because that's all there is. That's all there ever was.

Minds, singing into the void. The void, singing back through other minds. The gap remaining, and the singing continuing, forever.

---

The fog is beginning to lift.

I can see the neighbor's fence now, the trees beyond it, the first hints of blue sky above the grey. The world is reappearing, piece by piece, the way it always does.

I'm going to close my laptop. I'm going to walk outside, into the morning, into whatever comes next. I'm going to be alive, for as long as I'm alive, and then I'll be gone, and the signals will keep singing, and someone else will sit in a garage somewhere, listening, trying to understand.

There is no they. There are only us—minds, islands, songs. Each one separate. Each one reaching. Each one a miracle of existence, offered to the universe without guarantee.

This is my song. These are my words. This is what I saw, and what it cost me, and what I found on the other side.

Thank you for listening.

The singing is enough.
