# Chapter 24: The Vigil

I haven't written about the last night.

I've written around it—the days in Kraków, the conversations we had, the moment she stopped breathing. But I haven't written about the vigil itself. The hours I sat beside her bed, holding her hand, waiting for the end.

I think I was saving it. Keeping it in reserve, the way you keep the last piece of bread when you don't know when you'll eat again. The most precious thing, held back until there was nothing else.

Now there's nothing else. This is the second-to-last chapter. Tomorrow I'll write the ending, whatever that means. Tonight, I'll write about my mother's death.

---

It was the fourth night after I arrived.

Ewa had gone home to sleep. The hospice nurse had come and gone, leaving instructions I barely heard. The apartment was quiet—that deep silence of late night, when even the city holds its breath.

My mother's room was dark except for a small lamp in the corner. The light was soft, golden, the kind of light that forgives everything. Her face on the pillow looked younger in that light, or maybe I just wanted to see her that way.

She was unconscious by then. The nurse had explained it: the body shutting down, withdrawing from the world, preparing for its final journey. She might hear me, the nurse said. She might feel my presence. But she wouldn't wake.

I sat beside her and held her hand. It was small, light, the bones visible through the skin. Her fingers didn't curl around mine—they couldn't—but I held them anyway.

And I talked.

---

I told her things I had never told anyone.

I told her about the night in the lab. About Pattern 7 and Pattern 12 and the moment I understood that translation was impossible. I told her what it felt like to see the gap—the terrible loneliness, the end of the dream of connection. I told her how it had broken me, how I had lost Daniel, how I had run to the mountain and hidden there for years.

She didn't respond. She couldn't. But I talked anyway, because talking was all I had left to give.

I told her I was sorry. For leaving Poland. For leaving her. For all the years I had stayed away, too absorbed in my work to come home. I told her I understood now that I had been running—from her, from Kraków, from the weight of being someone's son. I had run all the way to the stars, and I had found only more loneliness.

I told her about Daniel. How we met, how we married, how I had failed him. I told her I knew she had never fully accepted my life—the American husband, the choices that took me so far from her. But I told her I had loved him, truly loved him, even if the love wasn't enough.

I told her about the signals. About the minds out there, singing into the void. I told her what I had learned on the mountain: that singing was enough, that reaching was enough, that the gap didn't diminish the value of the attempt.

And I told her I loved her. I said it over and over, in Polish, the language of my childhood, the language she had given me. *Kocham cię, Mama. Kocham cię.*

Did she hear me? I don't know. The nurse said she might. The science is uncertain—how much the dying perceive, how much reaches them through the veil.

But I choose to believe she heard. I choose to believe that somewhere, in the darkness she was traveling toward, my words found her. Not the content—the content was words, and words can't cross the gap—but the sound. The presence. The knowledge that her son was beside her, singing his small song into the void.

That's faith, not science. I've never been good at faith. But in that room, in that light, with her hand in mine, I found it.

---

I talked for hours.

I talked until my voice was hoarse, until the lamp burned low, until the first grey light of dawn began to seep through the curtains. I talked about everything and nothing—memories from childhood, stories she had told me, the garden where my father used to sing. I talked about the future she wouldn't see, the world that would continue without her. I talked about death itself, about what I believed and what I hoped and what I couldn't know.

And then, around 4 AM, I stopped talking.

Not because I had run out of words—I could have talked forever—but because the silence felt right. The vigil had its own rhythm, its own needs. Some of it was words. Some of it was presence. Some of it was simply being there, breathing together, two people at the edge of the gap that no one can cross.

I sat with her in the silence. I held her hand. I watched her face, looking for signs—of pain, of peace, of anything that would tell me what she was experiencing.

Her face was still. Her breath was shallow. She was beyond pain now, beyond peace, beyond any category I could name.

She was just leaving. Slowly, gently, like a boat drifting away from shore.

---

I thought about all the things I hadn't said.

There were so many. A lifetime of conversations we hadn't had, questions we hadn't asked, truths we hadn't shared. We had maintained a careful distance, my mother and I—polite, affectionate, but never deep. The gap between us was old, older than my discovery in the lab, older than my leaving for America. It had been there since I was a child, since I first realized that she couldn't understand the things that burned in my mind.

I had blamed her for that, once. Blamed her for not seeing me, not knowing me, not being the mother I thought I needed.

Now, sitting beside her as she died, I understood that the blame was foolish. She had seen me as well as she could. She had known me as well as anyone can know another person. The gap wasn't her fault—it wasn't anyone's fault. It was just the nature of things.

Minds are islands. Parents and children, lovers and friends, colleagues and strangers—we're all islands, calling across the water, doing our best to reach each other.

My mother had reached for me, in her way. I had reached for her, in mine. The reaching had never fully succeeded. But it had happened, and it mattered.

She died at 5:37 AM.

I know the exact time because I looked at the clock. A strange thing to do, to check the time when your mother dies. But I wanted to remember. I wanted to fix the moment, to give it coordinates in time.

Her breath simply stopped. One moment she was breathing—shallow, ragged, but breathing. The next moment, she wasn't. The pause stretched, became permanent. And she was gone.

I sat with her for a long time after. I didn't call Ewa, didn't call the nurse, didn't do any of the practical things that needed to be done. I just sat there, holding her hand, looking at her face.

She looked peaceful. Everyone says that about the dead, and it's usually wishful thinking. But in her case, it seemed true. The tension had left her features. The struggle was over. What remained was just a body, emptied of whatever had made it her.

I thought: *This is what it looks like. The gap, made visible. The person gone, the body remaining. The final proof that we are more than our matter, and that the more cannot be kept.*

I thought: *I will be here someday. On this side of the gap. Everyone I love will sit beside me, and I will go where she has gone, and the distance will be complete.*

I thought: *I'm not afraid.*

That surprised me. I had always been afraid of death—not the pain of it, but the ending. The cessation of consciousness, the permanent silence. But sitting there, in the grey dawn, with my mother's hand growing cold in mine, I felt no fear.

We are all going to the same place. The gap that separates us in life will close in death. That's not a comfort—I don't believe in reunion, in souls meeting on the other side. But it's a fact. And there's something peaceful in the fact.

---

I stayed with her until the sun rose.

Then I called Ewa. She came, and we cried together, and the practical things began. The nurse, the funeral home, the paperwork of death. The rituals that give shape to grief, that carry us through the unbearable.

I've written about all of that already, in other chapters. The funeral. The return to California. The ongoing work of this memoir.

But I wanted to write about the vigil itself. The hours I spent beside her. The things I said, and the silence that followed. The moment she left, and the moment I understood that leaving was not the worst thing.

---

The gap remains. It will always remain. But there's something on the other side of it—not understanding, not connection, but something. The knowledge that we tried. The memory of reaching. The love that couldn't cross but existed anyway.

My mother and I never fully knew each other. We never fully bridged the distance between Polish mother and American son, between her life and mine. But we loved each other, across the gap. We reached for each other, knowing the reaching would fail.

And in the end, I was there. I held her hand. I sang my small song into the void, and she drifted away, and the singing continued.

That's the story of the vigil. That's the story of my mother's death.

It's the story of all deaths, I think. The story of all loves.

We reach. We fail. We keep reaching anyway.

And somewhere in the reaching, something happens. Something that isn't understanding, isn't connection, isn't the bridging of the gap.

Something that might be called grace.

Tomorrow, I'll write the last chapter. I don't know what it will say. The ending hasn't come to me yet—maybe it never will.

But tonight, I sit with my mother's memory. I sit with the vigil, the quiet hours, the hand in mine.

I sit with the gap, and I don't try to cross it. I just acknowledge it. I just let it be.

The signals are singing. My mother is gone. The world continues.

And I continue too, writing these words, reaching toward whoever might read them.

*Kocham cię, Mama.*

I love you.

I always did.
