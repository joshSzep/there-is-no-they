# Chapter 22: The Mountain

I bought the cabin in February 2047—one month after I resigned from the project, four months after Daniel left.

It was in the Sierra Nevada, above the town of Lone Pine, at the end of a dirt road that became impassable in winter. A small place: one room, a woodstove, a sleeping loft reached by a ladder. No internet, no cell service, no connection to the world I was leaving behind.

The real estate agent thought I was crazy. "You understand there's no utilities up there?" she said. "No running water. You'd have to haul everything in, heat with wood, use an outhouse. It's not a place to live—it's a hunting cabin, a weekend thing."

"I understand," I said.

"And you want to live there? Full time?"

"Yes."

She shook her head, but she took my money. I signed the papers, received the keys, drove up the mountain with a truck full of supplies and a mind full of nothing.

I was fifty years old. I had spent twenty-five years studying language, communication, the possibility of reaching other minds. And I had learned that the reaching was impossible, that the gap was real, that we were all alone no matter how loudly we called into the void.

I didn't know what else to do. So I went to the mountain.

I'm writing this in the garage again. My usual place, my usual fog.

But something has changed since Kraków. Something subtle, hard to name. The emptiness I felt after the funeral has shifted into something else—not fullness, exactly, but openness. A willingness to be present in a way I haven't felt for years.

Maybe it's just grief, doing its work. Maybe it's the memoir, approaching its end. Maybe it's nothing, and I'll wake up tomorrow as closed and guarded as ever.

But today, I can write about the mountain. Today, I can go back there.

---

The first months were hard.

I knew nothing about living off-grid. I learned through failure—the fire that went out in the night and left me shivering, the water I didn't store before the first freeze, the food I didn't preserve and watched rot. I made mistakes that could have killed me, and I was lucky enough to survive them.

Slowly, I learned. I learned to chop wood, to read the weather, to ration supplies for the long winters. I learned the rhythms of the mountain: the spring thaw that turned the roads to mud, the summer heat that brought hikers and tourists, the autumn gold that preceded the snow, the winter silence that swallowed everything.

I hiked. That's what I did, mostly. Every day that weather allowed, I walked the trails—up to the peaks, down to the valleys, across the high meadows where wildflowers bloomed in July. I walked until my body was tired enough to sleep, until my mind was empty enough to rest.

The walking was a kind of meditation. Not the sitting-still kind—I could never do that—but the moving kind. The rhythm of footsteps, the breath coming hard on the climbs, the world reduced to the next rock, the next step, the next breath. In those moments, I wasn't thinking about the signals, the gap, the loneliness I had discovered. I was just walking.

Let me tell you about the view from Mount Whitney.

It's the highest peak in the contiguous United States—14,505 feet, a long day's climb from the trailhead. I did it for the first time in July 2047, five months after I moved to the cabin.

The climb was brutal. Eleven miles, six thousand feet of elevation gain, the air thinning as I rose. My lungs burned. My legs ached. My mind, for once, was quiet—too focused on the physical effort to wander.

I reached the summit at midday. I stood on the highest point in the Sierra, looking out at a world that stretched forever in every direction.

To the east, the desert—brown and gold, shimmering in the heat. To the west, the range continuing, peak after peak, ridges and valleys folding into blue distance. Above me, the sky—impossibly deep, that dark blue you only see at altitude, the atmosphere thinning toward space.

And everywhere, silence. Not the absence of sound—there was wind, the occasional bird, the creak of my own bones—but the absence of human noise. No engines, no voices, no signals carrying meaning through the air.

I stood there for a long time. I thought about the alien signals, still streaming through the cosmos, passing through me even now, undetectable without the equipment I had left behind. I thought about all the minds that had sent them, had offered their songs to the void, had hoped for connection and received only silence.

And I thought: *I understand now. I understand why they keep singing.*

---

Not because the singing would be heard. Not because connection was possible. But because singing was what they were. Because expression was as natural as breathing, as inevitable as existence itself.

The signals weren't failed attempts at communication. They were successful attempts at being. Each one said: *I am here. I exist. I have thoughts and feelings and experiences, and I am putting them into the world, and that is enough.*

I don't know if this is true. I don't know if the senders thought of their signals this way, or if they hoped for response, or if "hope" even translates across the gap. But standing on that mountain, looking out at the impossible vastness of the world, I believed it.

The singing was enough. The reaching was enough. Even without arrival.

---

I came down from the mountain different than I had gone up.

Not transformed—transformation is a word for stories, not for life. But shifted. Tilted slightly toward something that might, eventually, become peace.

I kept hiking. I climbed every peak within range—Whitney again, Williamson, Langley, Russell. I walked the John Muir Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail, the high routes that required no trail at all. I walked until walking was as natural as thinking, until the mountains were as familiar as rooms.

And slowly, very slowly, the understanding that had broken me began to change.

It was still true. The gap was still real. Minds were still islands, singing into the void. But the truth was no longer only devastating. It was also, somehow, beautiful.

The beauty was not a consolation—not a compensation for the loss, not a silver lining to the cloud. The beauty was part of the truth itself. The same fact that made us alone also made us individual. The same gap that prevented perfect understanding also created the space for wonder.

Each signal was unique. Each mind was unique. Each song was the expression of a perspective that had never existed before and would never exist again.

And that was not a tragedy. That was a miracle.

---

I'm crying.

I didn't expect that. I've been writing for hours, dry-eyed, clinical, and now suddenly I'm crying.

Maybe it's my mother. Maybe it's Daniel. Maybe it's the memory of standing on Whitney, seeing for the first time that the loneliness was not the whole story.

Or maybe it's just this: I'm sixty-two years old. I've spent twenty years living with an understanding that I thought had ruined me. And now, writing it down, trying to give it form, I'm discovering that it didn't ruin me. It changed me. But I'm still here.

The signals are still singing. I'm still singing. The gap remains, and the singing continues, and somehow that's enough.

---

I lived in the cabin for eight years.

Eight years of mountains and silence and slow healing. Eight years of learning to be alone without being lonely—or rather, learning that loneliness wasn't the enemy I had thought it was. Loneliness was just the shape of a mind, the contour of an island, the inevitable condition of being a self in a world of other selves.

I read. I wrote—not this memoir, but notes, fragments, attempts at understanding that never cohered. I listened to the wind and the birds and the occasional hiker passing on the trail below. I grew a garden, failed at it, grew another one. I watched the seasons turn, year after year, the same patterns repeating with infinite variation.

And I thought about Daniel, and my mother, and Maya, and all the people I had failed to reach. I thought about them not with guilt, exactly—I had moved past the worst of the guilt—but with something like tenderness. They were islands too. They had done their best to sing, to reach, to connect. That their songs had not reached me fully was not their failure. It was just the nature of things.

---

In 2055, I came down from the mountain.

Not because I was done—you're never done—but because I was ready. Ready to be around people again, ready to try the imperfect bridges, ready to sing knowing that my song might not be heard.

I sold the cabin. I moved back to the Bay Area, to this garage in Oakland, to the fog and the city and the life I had left behind. I got a part-time job—nothing glamorous, just tutoring at the community college, teaching languages to people who would never use them but wanted to learn anyway.

And I started this memoir. I started trying to put into words what I had learned on the mountain, in the lab, in the ruins of my marriage and the death of my mother.

I'm still trying. I'll never finish. But the trying is the point.

---

The fog is burning off. Late afternoon light is breaking through, turning the grey to gold.

I have three more chapters to write. The end of the project. The death of my mother. The meaning of all this, if meaning is the right word.

But I want to stay here a moment longer. In the memory of the mountain, the summit of Whitney, the first time I understood that loneliness could be beautiful.

We are alone. We will always be alone. The gap is real, and love cannot cross it, and understanding is never complete.

But we sing anyway. We reach anyway. We build our imperfect bridges and watch them fail and build them again.

That's what life is. That's what the signals are. That's what this memoir is—a song, sent into the void, hoping to be heard but not requiring it.

The singing is enough.

I believe that now. After everything, I believe it.

The singing is enough.
