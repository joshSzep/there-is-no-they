# Chapter 20: The Unraveling

Systems fail slowly, then all at once.

I've watched it happen with the project. I've watched it happen with my marriage. I'm watching it happen now, with my mother—the long decline, the gradual weakening, and then the final collapse that feels sudden even though nothing about it is sudden.

There's a threshold you cross. Before the threshold, failure is happening but might still be reversed. After, the outcome is certain. The system continues to function, but it's already dead—just playing out the motions, the inertia carrying it forward while the life drains away.

My mother crossed that threshold sometime in the night. Ewa called me at 4 AM, her voice strange and flat.

"Tom. You should come."

I came. I'm here now, in my mother's room, watching her breathe. The breaths are shallow, irregular, separated by pauses that stretch longer each time. The doctor came an hour ago. "Hours," he said. "Maybe less."

So I sit beside her, and I write, because writing is all I know how to do, and because there's nothing else to do while you wait for someone to die.

Let me tell you about the unraveling.

The leak was the beginning, but only the beginning. A system as large as the Signal Translation Project doesn't collapse from a single wound. It takes time. It takes accumulation. It takes the steady erosion of trust, of funding, of faith.

The congressional hearings started in June 2045—three months after the leak, two years after my night in the lab.

I was called to testify. Not as a hostile witness—they were careful about that—but as an expert. A senior researcher who could explain the technical details, help the committee understand what we'd discovered and what it meant.

I sat in a hearing room in Washington, D.C., facing a row of senators who knew nothing about signals or xenolinguistics but knew everything about political theater. The cameras were rolling. The public was watching. The project's future hung in the balance.

"Dr. Kowalski," the chairman said, "let me ask you directly: Is universal translation of the extraterrestrial signals possible?"

I looked at Maya, sitting in the gallery, her face composed but her eyes burning. I looked at David, beside her, his expression unreadable. I looked at the senators, waiting for an answer that would fit neatly into a sound bite.

"Senator," I said, "I believe the evidence strongly suggests that the signals do not share a common underlying structure. Translation between them—or from them to human languages—would require bridging gaps that may be unbridgeable."

"May be unbridgeable. So you're saying it might still be possible?"

The trap was obvious. If I said no, I was contradicting the project's official position. If I said yes, I was giving them false hope.

"I'm saying that the challenges are more fundamental than we initially believed. Whether they can be overcome is an open question. But it would be misleading to suggest that translation is around the corner, or even on the horizon."

The chairman nodded. He had what he needed—a quote, a clip, a moment that would play on the evening news.

"Thank you, Dr. Kowalski. I think we all appreciate your candor."

My mother's breathing has changed. The pauses are longer now, the breaths more labored.

I've put down my laptop. I'm holding her hand. Ewa is on the other side of the bed, silent, watching.

There's nothing to say. There's nothing to do. We just wait, and witness, and let the end arrive.

---

The hearings continued for months. Maya testified. David testified. Rachel testified. A parade of researchers and administrators, each one carefully parsing their words, trying to maintain the project's credibility while acknowledging the leaked documents.

The political mood had shifted. The project had been a bipartisan darling—a symbol of human ambition, of our reach toward the cosmos, of the hope that we might someday talk to other minds. Now it was a symbol of institutional hubris, of money wasted, of promises broken.

The funding cuts came that fall. Not a complete defunding—there was still enough support to keep the project alive—but a reduction of 40 percent. Entire departments were eliminated. Researchers were let go. The Chen Building, once buzzing with activity, grew quiet.

Maya fought it. I watched her fight, watched her deploy every weapon in her arsenal—charm, expertise, political connections. She was brilliant, as always. She almost saved it.

But you can't fight a narrative. The story had been written: the project had oversold its potential, had misled the public, had spent billions on a dream that couldn't be realized. The story wasn't entirely true—the project had made real discoveries, had advanced human knowledge in countless ways—but nuance doesn't survive in headlines.

By the end of 2045, the Signal Translation Project was a shadow of what it had been. Still functioning, still doing research, but diminished. Wounded. Dying slowly, the way systems die.

---

She's stopped breathing.

I noticed it a moment ago—the stillness, the absence of movement. I waited, thinking it was another pause, a longer gap between breaths.

But the breath didn't come. The pause extended, became permanent.

Ewa is crying. I should be crying. But I'm just sitting here, holding my mother's hand, looking at her face.

She looks peaceful. That's what people say at moments like this, and it's true—the tension has left her features, the pain has withdrawn, and what remains is just stillness. Just the body, the vessel, empty now of whatever made it her.

I should close my laptop. I should be present for this moment, not writing about the project's collapse.

But she's gone. Being present for her is no longer possible.

So I write. Because writing is how I grieve. Because writing is the only ritual I have.

---

Let me finish the chapter.

Maya resigned in March 2046. Not publicly—publicly, she "stepped back to pursue other opportunities"—but we all knew. She had lost control of the project, lost the political battle, lost the narrative she had spent her life constructing.

I saw her the day she left. She was in her office—the office in the Chen Building, with the photos and the telescope and the view of the bay—packing boxes. Her face was composed, as always, but I could see the devastation underneath.

"Tom," she said. "I didn't expect to see you."

"I wanted to say goodbye."

She nodded. She continued packing—books, papers, the small personal items that had accumulated over a decade.

"I don't blame you," she said. "For any of it. I want you to know that."

"I know."

"You did what scientists are supposed to do. You followed the evidence. I'm the one who tried to manage the story, and I failed."

"You did what you thought was right."

She looked at me. Her eyes, for once, were unguarded—tired, sad, but clear.

"Did I? I'm not sure anymore. I thought I was protecting the project. But maybe I was just protecting myself. My legacy. My place in history."

She picked up a photo—one of the pictures from her wall, showing her at a podium, receiving some award.

"I wanted to be remembered as the woman who discovered alien intelligence," she said. "Instead, I'll be remembered as the woman who couldn't accept what that discovery meant."

"That's not fair. You did discover it. Everything that came after—"

"Everything that came after was my choice. I chose the framing. I chose to minimize what you'd found. I chose to protect the dream instead of facing the truth."

She put the photo in a box.

"I'm not a villain, Tom. I know that. But I'm not a hero either. I'm just a person who wanted something so badly that she couldn't see clearly."

The funeral is tomorrow.

Ewa has taken over the arrangements. I'm useless for practical things—I always have been—so I stay out of the way. I sit in my mother's kitchen, at the table where I sat as a child, and I write.

My mother is dead. The project is dead, or dying. My marriage is long dead.

So much death. So much ending.

And yet I'm still here. Still writing. Still trying to make sense of what happened, even though sense is not something that can be made of this.

---

After Maya left, I stayed another year. I don't know why. Habit, maybe. Fear of change. The inertia of a life that had lost its shape but not its motion.

I worked on Pattern 7. Not because I believed it would lead anywhere—I had stopped believing that long ago—but because working was easier than not working. Easier than facing the silence, the emptiness, the question of what to do next.

Daniel and I separated in the fall of 2046. I've already told you about that, or parts of it. The conversation we finally had, the admission that we couldn't reach each other anymore. The quiet dissolution of something that had once been everything.

He moved out. I stayed in the apartment, surrounded by the ghosts of what we'd been.

And then, in January 2047, I resigned.

No drama. No press release. Just a letter to the new director—someone I barely knew, an administrator brought in to manage the project's decline—saying that I was leaving. That I needed a change. That I was grateful for the opportunity.

The opportunity. As if discovering the loneliness of the cosmos was an opportunity.

---

Let me tell you about the years after.

I've mentioned them briefly—the quiet years, the hiking years, the years I spent alone in the mountains trying to outrun what I knew.

I sold the apartment. I bought a small cabin in the Sierra Nevada, far from cities, far from universities, far from signals. I lived there alone, walking the trails, watching the seasons change, letting the silence fill me.

I thought I was healing. I thought the distance from the work would eventually become a kind of peace.

But you can't outrun what's inside you. The understanding I'd gained in that lab—the knowledge of the gap, the unbridgeable distance between minds—it came with me. It was part of me now, woven into my perception.

I looked at the mountains and saw isolation. I looked at the trees and saw entities that couldn't communicate across the gap between species. I looked at other hikers, passing me on the trail, and saw minds trapped in skulls, reaching toward each other and never quite touching.

The beauty was still there. The world was still magnificent. But underneath the magnificence was the loneliness, the terrible loneliness that I had seen in the signals and couldn't unsee.

---

It's late now. Past midnight. The funeral is in a few hours.

Ewa has gone home to sleep. I'm alone in my mother's apartment, writing by the light of a single lamp.

The body has been taken away. The room where she died is empty, the bed stripped, the curtains closed.

I keep thinking about what she said, those last days. About my father singing in the garden. About how maybe singing is enough—singing for its own sake, not for an audience, not for understanding, just for the joy of it.

Maybe that's what the signals are. Singing. Not attempts to communicate—communication implies hope of reception, of response. Just singing. The expression of existence, offered to the void without expectation.

If that's true, then my discovery changes nothing. The signals were never messages to be translated. They were songs to be heard, imperfectly, from far away.

And we heard them. We couldn't understand them, couldn't translate them, couldn't bridge the gap. But we heard them.

Maybe that's enough. Maybe hearing is enough, even without understanding.

---

I don't know if I believe that. It sounds like consolation—the kind of consolation you reach for when the real hope is gone.

But tonight, sitting in my mother's empty apartment, surrounded by the belongings of a woman I loved but never fully knew—tonight, consolation is what I need.

The signals are singing. My mother is gone. The project is a memory.

And I'm here, still writing, still reaching, still trying to make words carry what words cannot carry.

Tomorrow I'll bury my mother. Then I'll go back to California, to the garage, to this memoir that I need to finish.

And then—I don't know. And then, whatever comes next.

The unraveling is complete. What's left is only the thread—thin, frayed, but still stretching forward into the unknown.

I hold onto it. It's all I have.

I hold onto it, and I keep writing, and I wait for the morning.
