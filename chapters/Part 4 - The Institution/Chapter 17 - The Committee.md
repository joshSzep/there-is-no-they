# Chapter 17: The Committee

My mother woke at noon, more alert than she'd been in days. Ewa said this happens sometimes—a rally, a brief resurgence before the end. The body gathering its last strength, the mind surfacing one final time.

We talked. Not about important things—not about the decades of distance, not about my father, not about the son who left and rarely returned. We talked about the weather. About the courtyard, which has new flowers this year. About a neighbor's cat that visits her windowsill.

Small talk. Surface. But present. Fully, completely present.

I held her hand. She held mine. The gap between us remained—it will remain until she dies—but we were on the same side of it, looking at each other, recognizing each other across the distance.

This evening, she's sleeping again. Ewa is in the other room, doing something on her phone. And I'm back at the kitchen table, writing about the committee.

---

Maya convened it in February 2044—six weeks after our meeting in her office.

She called it the "Pattern Analysis Review Board." An innocuous name, the kind of name designed to attract no attention. It consisted of twelve people: senior researchers, department heads, a few outside consultants with high security clearances. All of them handpicked by Maya. All of them trusted.

I was invited as the presenting researcher. It was my data, my analysis, my conclusion that was being reviewed. But I understood from the beginning that I was not in control of this process. Maya was.

The meeting took place in a conference room on the third floor—windowless, soundproofed, the kind of room used for sensitive discussions. I arrived early and found Maya already there, arranging papers, testing the projection system.

"Tom," she said. "Thank you for coming."

As if I had a choice. As if the committee wasn't designed specifically around my findings.

"Of course," I said.

---

Let me describe the committee members. Not all of them—I didn't know all of them—but the ones who mattered.

David Okonkwo was there, sitting at Maya's right hand. The deputy director, her most trusted lieutenant, the one who handled the politics while she focused on the science. He was a large man, calm and measured, with a face that revealed nothing. I had always liked David, though I couldn't say I knew him. He was the kind of person who maintained careful distance, who kept his true thoughts hidden.

Rachel Torres was there—the communications director, responsible for managing the project's public image. A woman in her fifties with grey-streaked hair and sharp, assessing eyes. She had been with the project since the beginning, had navigated a decade of media cycles, had learned exactly how to package complex findings for a public that wanted simplicity.

Yusuf was there, seated far from me, his face carefully neutral. He was the only other person in the room who knew what I was going to say—who had known for months—and I could see the tension in his shoulders, the effort of pretending he was hearing this for the first time.

The others were scientists, mostly. Specialists in signal analysis, computational linguistics, astrophysics. People who understood the technical details, who could evaluate my evidence on its merits. People who, I believed at the time, would follow the truth wherever it led.

I presented for two hours.

I started with the model—how I had built it, what assumptions it rested on, why it worked for Pattern 7. I showed the validation data, the predictive accuracy, the elegant internal consistency. I let them see the success before I showed them the failure.

Then I moved to Pattern 12. I walked them through the cross-checks, the contradictions, the seventeen points of irreconcilable difference. I showed them what the model produced when applied to a different signal: fluent, confident, wrong.

I concluded with the implications. If my model was local—and the evidence overwhelmingly suggested it was—then any model would be local. The signals did not share a common framework. Universal translation was not merely difficult; it was impossible.

When I finished, the room was silent.

I looked at Maya. Her face was unreadable, the same careful neutrality she had maintained throughout. But her hands, I noticed, were gripping the edge of the table.

"Thank you, Tom," she said. "That was very thorough. I'm sure the committee has questions."

---

The questions came in waves.

First, the technical questions. Had I verified the Pattern 12 data? Had I tested on other signals? Were there alternative interpretations of the cross-check failures?

I answered everything. I had anticipated these questions, had prepared answers, had documentation for every claim. The technical case was solid; I knew it was solid.

Then came the interpretive questions. What did "local" really mean? Was it possible the signals were related in ways my model hadn't captured? Could there be a deeper structure, a meta-framework, that unified them despite surface differences?

I answered these too, though the answers were harder. I couldn't prove that no unifying framework existed—you can never prove a negative—but I could explain why the evidence pointed away from unity and toward plurality. Why the most parsimonious interpretation was that the signals were genuinely separate, genuinely alien to each other.

Finally, there were the political questions. These came from Rachel, mostly, and from David.

"If we announce this," Rachel said, "what do we say? How do we frame it?"

"I don't know," I admitted. "I'm a scientist. Framing isn't my expertise."

"Let me rephrase. Is there a way to present this finding that doesn't... undermine everything we've been saying for ten years?"

I looked at her. I understood what she was asking. She wanted me to give her a narrative, a story, a way to tell the truth without telling the truth.

"I don't think so," I said. "The finding is what it is. We've been assuming the signals could be translated. That assumption is wrong."

Rachel's jaw tightened. She looked at Maya, a quick glance, some communication passing between them that I couldn't read.

---

My mother is restless tonight. I can hear her through the wall—small sounds, murmurs, the distress of someone trapped in difficult dreams.

I should go to her. I should stop writing and sit beside her bed and hold her hand.

But I need to finish this chapter. I need to tell you what happened in that room, what the committee decided, how the system responded when the truth proved inconvenient.

---

The discussion went on for hours.

Maya let everyone speak. She asked clarifying questions, drew out disagreements, made sure every perspective was heard. It was a masterful performance—the appearance of open inquiry, democratic deliberation, following the evidence wherever it led.

But I could feel, underneath the discussion, a current pulling toward a predetermined conclusion. The questions kept circling back to the same concerns: How would this look? What would the funders think? How could we manage the fallout?

Not: Is this true? Not: What does this mean for our understanding of the universe?

But: How do we survive this?

At some point—I don't remember exactly when—Yusuf spoke up. He had been quiet throughout, watching, waiting. But now he raised his hand, and Maya nodded to him.

"I've reviewed Tom's data independently," he said. "The technical analysis is sound. The cross-checks are valid. I believe his conclusions are correct."

A murmur went through the room. Yusuf's endorsement carried weight; he was respected, careful, not given to overstatement.

"However," he continued, "I also want to note that this finding, while scientifically significant, doesn't mean the project has failed. We've learned something important about the nature of the signals. That's progress, even if it's not the progress we expected."

It was a generous framing. A kind framing. A framing that tried to give the committee a way forward that didn't involve burying the truth.

I looked at Yusuf with gratitude. He met my eyes briefly, then looked away.

Maya called for a break around 4 PM. People stood, stretched, headed for the bathroom or the coffee machine. I stayed in my seat, suddenly exhausted.

David approached me. He pulled up a chair and sat beside me, his large body somehow folding into the small space.

"How are you holding up?" he asked.

"I'm fine."

"This must be difficult. Presenting findings that contradict everything we've been working toward."

"It's not about contradiction. It's about truth."

He nodded slowly. "Truth is important. But so is context. So is timing. So is the way we communicate what we've learned."

I looked at him. "What are you saying?"

"I'm saying that there are ways to present this finding that preserve the project's integrity. That don't panic the funders or the public. That give us time to understand the implications before we make sweeping announcements."

"You're saying we should suppress it."

"I'm saying we should be strategic. There's a difference."

I wanted to argue. I wanted to say that strategic communication was just suppression with better public relations. But David's face was kind, concerned—the face of someone who genuinely believed he was helping.

"Think about it," he said. "That's all I'm asking."

---

The break ended. The committee reconvened. Maya stood at the head of the table, and I could see that something had shifted. During the break, conversations had happened—small groups in corners, whispered consultations. A consensus was forming.

"I think we've heard enough to make a preliminary decision," Maya said. "We need to verify Tom's findings through independent analysis. That will take time—several months at least. In the meantime, I recommend we maintain operational continuity. No public announcements, no changes to our research priorities. We proceed as normal until we have a clearer picture."

She looked around the table. "Is there any objection?"

No one spoke. Yusuf was staring at the table. Rachel was nodding. David's face was impassive.

"Then we're agreed. Tom, I want to thank you for bringing this to us. Your integrity is admirable. We'll keep you informed as the review proceeds."

And that was it. The committee meeting was over. The finding had been received, processed, and set aside—not rejected, not accepted, just deferred. Frozen in amber while the institution decided what to do with it.

---

My mother called for me. I heard her voice, thin and distant, through the wall: "Tomek? Tomek?"

I closed my laptop and went to her.

She was awake, her eyes confused, reaching for me.

"I'm here, Mama. I'm here."

"I thought you had left. I thought you had gone back to America."

"No. I'm still here."

She relaxed. Her hand found mine, and she held it tightly, with more strength than I expected.

"Stay," she said. "Stay a little longer."

"I'll stay."

We sat together in the darkness. Outside, Kraków was sleeping—the old city with its ancient walls, the squares where I had played as a child, the world I had left and never quite returned to.

"Tomek," she said after a while.

"Yes?"

"I know you have important work. I know I'm keeping you from it."

"You're not keeping me from anything."

"But your signals. Your aliens. They need you."

I almost laughed. My mother, on her deathbed, worried about the aliens.

"The signals can wait," I said. "They've been traveling for thousands of years. They'll still be there when I get back."

She smiled—a small smile, barely visible in the dark.

"I'm glad you came," she said. "I wasn't sure you would."

"I should have come sooner."

"You came. That's what matters."

The gap between us—the years, the distance, the languages we had never found to speak to each other—it was still there. But she was right: I came. In the end, that was what I had to offer. Not words. Not explanation. Just presence.

I stayed with her until she fell asleep. Then I came back to the kitchen, to my laptop, to this chapter that needed finishing.

---

The committee meeting was the beginning of a year of delay.

Independent analysis that took months, then more months. Reviews of the reviews. Discussions about framing, about timing, about strategic communication. Maya kept me informed, as she'd promised—brief emails, occasional meetings, always with the same message: *We're still evaluating. We need more time. Be patient.*

And I was patient. Too patient, I see now. I let the institution absorb my finding, process it, metabolize it into something manageable.

By the time the truth finally emerged, it was too late. The framing had been chosen. The narrative had been set. And the gap between what I had discovered and what the world was told—that gap was wider than any gap between minds, any distance between signals.

But that's the next chapter. For now, I sit in my mother's kitchen, listening to her breathe, waiting for the morning.

The committee decided to be careful. The committee decided to be strategic. The committee decided to manage the truth.

And I let them. I let them because I was tired, because I wanted someone else to carry the weight, because I believed—foolishly, naively—that the system would eventually do the right thing.

The system did what systems do. It protected itself.

And I learned what I should have already known: that truth is not enough. That truth, without power, without position, without the ability to control the narrative, is just a voice crying in the wilderness.

The signals are still out there, singing their separate songs. The gap is still unbridgeable.

And I am here, in Kraków, holding my mother's hand, waiting.

This is what remains, when everything else is stripped away.

Presence. Witness. Waiting.

It's not enough. It's never enough.

But it's all I have.
