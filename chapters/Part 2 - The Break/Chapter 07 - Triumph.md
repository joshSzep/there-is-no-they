# Chapter 7: Triumph

Let me stay here a moment longer.

I know I've already told you how it ended. I've already described the failure, the silence, the mouth that opened and found nothing to say. But I want to go back. I want to live in those thirty minutes again—the brief window between 11:47 PM and whenever I opened Pattern 12. The last time I was the person I had always believed myself to be.

This is the privilege of memoir: you can stop time. You can hold a moment in your hands and turn it over, examine it from every angle, refuse to let it pass.

In life, I couldn't do that. In life, the thirty minutes were already gone before I knew they mattered.

The fog broke this morning, suddenly, as if someone had pulled a curtain. The bay appeared all at once—blue and glittering, the bridge vivid against it, the hills of Marin green in the distance. I stood at the window and watched, and I thought about how quickly things can change. One moment, white. The next, the whole world.

My phone sits on the desk. I still haven't called.

Instead, I return to May 17th. I return to the hour I was happy.

---

Do you know what I imagined, in those thirty minutes?

I imagined telling Daniel. I saw myself coming home—not that night, because it was too late, but the next morning. I would wake him with coffee, the way he liked. I would sit on the edge of the bed, and I would say: "I did it."

And he would understand. Not the technical details—he never cared about those—but the weight. The years. The finally. He would put down the coffee and pull me into his arms, and we would hold each other, and for once I wouldn't be thinking about Pattern 7 because Pattern 7 would be solved.

I imagined the rest of our lives. The life after the breakthrough.

I would publish, of course. A major paper, probably in Nature, with my name first and a list of acknowledgments a page long. There would be press attention—not Maya-level fame, but recognition. Interviews, maybe. Invitations to conferences. The quiet linguist on the fourth floor, finally seen.

And then I would rest. That was the fantasy I kept returning to, in those thirty minutes. After the paper, after the attention, after I had given the project what I owed it—I would rest. I would come home at reasonable hours. I would cook dinner with Daniel instead of heating up leftovers alone. I would be present in my marriage in a way I hadn't been for years.

I would visit my mother. I promised myself that. As soon as things settled down, as soon as the immediate chaos of the discovery passed, I would fly to Kraków. I would sit in her kitchen and drink tea and tell her what I had done. She wouldn't fully understand—she never understood my work—but she would be proud. I would see it in her face, the careful pride she never quite said aloud.

I imagined all of this in thirty minutes. A whole future, built on the foundation of a working model.

---

I need to stop here. I need to acknowledge what I'm doing.

I'm avoiding the next part. I'm circling around the wreckage, unwilling to look at it directly. The present-Tom, sitting in this garage, writing this memoir—he knows what comes next. He knows how foolish these imaginings were, how quickly they turned to ash.

But the past-Tom didn't know. The past-Tom sat in that empty lab, in the glow of screens that showed him a success, and he let himself believe.

Is it cruel to dwell on this? To describe the hope in such detail, knowing it was about to be destroyed?

Maybe. But this is what memoir is for. To bear witness to the selves we used to be, even when—especially when—those selves were about to walk into catastrophe.

---

Let me tell you about the room.

The lab on the fourth floor of the Chen Building was not a beautiful space. Fluorescent lights, dropped ceiling, industrial carpet in a color that might once have been blue. Rows of desks with ergonomic chairs that no one had ever adjusted. Screens everywhere, glowing with data, casting the only light at that hour.

My desk was in the corner, near the window. During the day, I could see the campanile, the bay, the hills beyond. At night, I saw only my own reflection, superimposed on darkness.

In those thirty minutes, I looked at that reflection. I saw a man I barely recognized.

He was forty-two years old. His hair was going grey at the temples—had been for years, but he rarely noticed. His face was tired, lined in ways that suggested he had spent too much time squinting at screens. His shoulders were hunched forward, the posture of someone who had spent a decade reaching for something just out of grasp.

But his eyes. In those thirty minutes, his eyes were different.

I don't know how to describe it except to say: they were open. Fully open, in a way they hadn't been for years. The habitual guardedness, the careful skepticism, the armor of low expectations—all of it was gone. The man in the window was looking at the world as if it had just given him a gift.

I miss that man. I miss the thirty minutes when I was him.

I thought about calling my mother.

Not seriously—it was nearly midnight in California, which meant it was morning in Kraków, and she would have been starting her day. She didn't like unexpected calls; they worried her. She would assume something was wrong.

But I thought about it. I imagined picking up the phone, hearing her voice, saying "Mama, I did it."

What would she have said? Something cautious, probably. She was always cautious. "That's wonderful, Tomek. What did you do?"

And I would have tried to explain—the signal, the model, the eight years. She would have listened, not understanding, making small noises of encouragement. And at the end, she would have said something like: "I'm proud of you. When are you coming to visit?"

Always that question. When are you coming to visit?

I never had a good answer. I still don't.

---

Let me tell you what I thought it meant.

In those thirty minutes, sitting in the lab with my successful model, I believed I had proved something important. Not just about Pattern 7—about the nature of alien communication, about the structure of meaning across the cosmos.

If my model worked, I thought, it meant the signals were comprehensible. It meant that despite the vast distances, despite the differences in biology and history and physics, intelligence could recognize intelligence. Meaning could cross the void.

This was the dream of the project. The dream I had come to Berkeley to pursue. The dream that had sustained me through eight years of failure.

And for thirty minutes, I believed the dream was true.

I believed that my work on Pattern 7 was just the beginning. That the same methods, refined and extended, would unlock other signals. That piece by piece, pattern by pattern, we would assemble a picture of a universe full of minds reaching toward each other.

I believed we were not alone—not just in the sense that other intelligence existed, but in the deeper sense that other intelligence was reachable. That the gap could be bridged. That communication was possible.

This is what I lost, when I opened Pattern 12. Not just a model, not just a career. I lost the belief that had organized my life.

---

The sun is moving across the floor. I've been writing for hours.

I keep returning to those thirty minutes because I don't want to leave them. Because what comes next is harder to write, harder to think about, harder to hold in my mind without flinching.

But I have to leave them. That's what memoir demands—not just the dwelling, but the departure. Not just the hope, but the loss.

---

At some point—I don't know exactly when—I stopped imagining the future and started thinking about the present.

I looked at my screen, at the model that worked, at the results that would change everything. And a small, cautious voice in my head said: *Test it again.*

Not because I doubted. Because I was a scientist, and scientists verify. Because I had been wrong so many times before, and I needed to be sure.

*Test it on something new,* the voice said. *Something you haven't seen. Something that will prove it's real.*

Pattern 12 was right there. The obvious choice. A signal from the same region of sky, waiting in the database, never touched by my model.

If I had stopped there—if I had documented my results, gone home, come back in the morning with fresh eyes—would things have been different? Would I have run the same test eventually and reached the same conclusion?

Probably. Almost certainly. The truth doesn't change based on when you find it.

But I wouldn't have lost those thirty minutes. I could have kept them a little longer—an night, a day, a week. I could have told Daniel. I could have called my mother. I could have lived in the future I imagined, at least for a while.

Instead, I opened Pattern 12. I pressed enter. I watched the output appear.

And the thirty minutes ended.

---

I've told you already what I saw. The fluent nonsense, the confident error, the realization that my model was local, particular, irreproducible.

I won't tell it again. Once is enough.

But I want you to understand the weight of it. The distance from where I was to where I ended up. Thirty minutes earlier, I was a man who had decoded an alien signal, who was imagining his future, who believed the universe was full of reachable minds.

Thirty minutes later, I was a man who had proved the opposite. Who knew that the signals were islands, each one a separate world, no bridges between them. Who would spend the next twenty years trying to explain what that meant, and failing, and watching everything he loved slip away.

Thirty minutes. That's all it took.

---

Tomorrow I will write about Pattern 12 in more detail. The technical failure, the verification, the long hours of testing that confirmed what I already knew.

Tonight, I sit with the triumph. I let myself remember what it felt like to believe.

My mother is dying. I am here, writing about thirty minutes that happened twenty years ago. There is something wrong with me—something broken in the way I process time, the way I allocate attention, the way I decide what matters.

But this is the only way I know. To put it in words. To build a structure out of memory and hope that the structure holds.

Thirty minutes of triumph. A lifetime of aftermath.

The sun is setting. The bridge is turning gold.

I should call. I should pack. I should go.

Instead, I close my eyes and remember. The lab. The screens. The man in the window, eyes open, believing.

He didn't know. He couldn't have known.

I forgive him for what he was about to do.
