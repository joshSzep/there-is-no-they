# Chapter 10: The Hours After

I did not book the flight.

I meant to. I closed the laptop, I walked to the kitchen, I poured a glass of water. I stood at the counter and thought: *I will open my phone, I will go to the airline website, I will choose a seat and enter my payment information and it will be done.*

But I didn't. Instead, I stood there drinking water and looking out at the fog, and then I walked back to my desk, and then I opened my laptop again, and now I am writing this.

I don't know how to explain this. I don't know how to justify it. My mother is dying in Kraków and I am sitting in a garage in California writing about the night I came home from the lab.

But this is what I do. This is what I've always done. When the world becomes unbearable, I retreat into words. I arrange them carefully, as if arrangement could create meaning, as if meaning could create control.

It doesn't work. It has never worked. But I keep doing it anyway, because the alternative is to face the unbearable directly, and I have never learned how.

---

Let me tell you about the hours after.

I left the lab around 4 AM. The fog was thick—I've mentioned that—and the campus was empty. My footsteps echoed on the pavement, unnaturally loud in the silence. The streetlights made halos in the mist, each one a small island of orange in the grey.

I walked slowly. Not because I was tired, though I was. Not because I was thinking, though I was doing that too. I walked slowly because I didn't want to arrive.

Our apartment was a twenty-minute walk from the Chen Building. A small place, third floor, one bedroom. We'd moved there when I joined the project—Daniel had found it, negotiated the lease, organized the move while I was buried in preliminary data. He was good at that. He was good at all the things I wasn't good at.

I walked slowly because I knew that when I arrived, I would have to be a person again. A husband. A man with a face that meant something to someone else. And I didn't know how to be that anymore. I didn't know who I was.

---

The first lie was not a lie.

That's important to understand. When I came home that night, I didn't deceive Daniel. I didn't tell him something false, didn't construct a story to hide the truth. I simply didn't speak.

He was asleep. It was 4:30 in the morning; of course he was asleep. I let myself in quietly, took off my shoes in the hallway, moved through the dark apartment with the careful steps of someone trying not to wake anyone.

I stood in the doorway of the bedroom and watched him sleep.

This is a cliché, I know. The lover watching the beloved sleep. But clichés become clichés because they're true, because they capture something that happens again and again across all the bedrooms of the world.

Daniel slept on his side, facing the window. The streetlight filtered through the curtains, catching the curve of his shoulder, the dark hair against the white pillow. He breathed slowly, evenly, the breath of someone deep in dreams.

I watched him for a long time. I thought about waking him. I thought about sitting on the edge of the bed, touching his shoulder, saying: *Daniel. Something happened. I need to tell you.*

But what would I tell him? The model worked and then it didn't? The signals are islands and we are alone? Everything I believed was wrong, and now I don't know what to believe?

He would have listened. He always listened. He would have sat up, rubbed his eyes, asked careful questions. And I would have tried to answer, and the answers would have been wrong—not because I was lying but because language was inadequate, because anything I said would create a picture that wasn't true.

So I didn't wake him. I stood in the doorway, watching him breathe, and I told myself: *Tomorrow. I'll tell him tomorrow, when I've had time to think, when I can explain it properly.*

That was the first lie. Not a false statement, but a postponement that would become infinite.

---

I slept on the couch that night. I told myself I didn't want to disturb him, which was true. But the deeper truth was that I couldn't bear to lie beside him. To feel his warmth, his presence, the familiar weight of another body in the bed. I couldn't bear to be that close to someone and know that the closeness was an illusion.

I lay on the couch and stared at the ceiling and watched the light change as the night gave way to morning. I didn't sleep—I knew I wouldn't sleep—but I lay very still, and I let my thoughts move in whatever direction they wanted.

They moved to strange places. I thought about my father, dead for fifteen years, and the way he used to sit at the kitchen table in Kraków, drinking vodka and staring at nothing. I had hated that silence, hated the way he retreated into himself, hated the distance I could feel even when he was in the same room. Now I understood it. Now I was doing the same thing.

I thought about the signals, all of them, streaming through the cosmos, carrying meanings we would never decode. I imagined the minds that had sent them—not their shapes or their biology, but their interiority. Their experience of being. Were they lonely too? Did they send signals into the void hoping for connection, knowing that connection was impossible?

I thought about language, about all the languages I knew, about the way each one created a different world. English made one kind of sense; Polish made another; German, French, Japanese, Mandarin—each one a lens that revealed some things and hid others. I had spent my life moving between these lenses, believing that translation was possible, that the meaning underneath was the same even when the words were different.

Now I knew that wasn't true. Even human languages were islands. We bridged them, approximately, imperfectly, but the bridges were never complete. Something was always lost. And alien languages—alien minds—were so much more distant that the bridges couldn't even begin.

---

Daniel woke around seven.

I heard him moving in the bedroom—the creak of the bed, the shuffle of feet, the sound of the bathroom door. Then the kitchen: water running, the coffee maker starting, the small domestic noises of morning.

"Tom?"

He had found me on the couch. I opened my eyes and saw him standing in the doorway, coffee cup in hand, wearing the blue robe I'd given him for his birthday.

"You slept out here?"

"I got home late. Didn't want to wake you."

He nodded, accepting this. It wasn't unusual; I'd slept on the couch before, after late nights in the lab. But something in his face suggested he knew this time was different.

"Everything okay?"

There it was. The question. The opening. I could have said *no, everything is not okay, something happened and I need to tell you.* I could have started the conversation that might have saved us.

"Fine," I said. "Just tired. Long night."

He looked at me for a moment—a long moment, searching. Then he nodded again.

"I'll make you some coffee."

He turned and walked back to the kitchen, and I lay on the couch and stared at the ceiling, and the distance between us grew by one more increment.

---

I'm going to pause here and acknowledge what I'm doing.

I'm writing about the moment my marriage began to end, and I'm doing it instead of getting on a plane to Kraków. I'm excavating a wound from twenty years ago while a fresh wound opens across the ocean.

Why?

I don't have a good answer. The best I can offer is this: the old wound and the new wound are the same wound. The silence that opened between Daniel and me that morning is the same silence that has kept me from my mother for decades. It's the same silence I'm trying to break now, with this memoir, with these inadequate words.

I couldn't talk to Daniel then. I can't talk to my mother now. But I can write. I can put the silence into sentences and send it out into the world, and maybe—maybe—someone will understand.

That's the hope, anyway. The desperate, foolish hope that has kept me writing for months.

---

Let me tell you about the rest of that day.

I showered. I ate the breakfast Daniel made—eggs, toast, coffee—tasting nothing. I put on clean clothes and walked back to campus, back to the Chen Building, back to the lab where everything had changed.

The morning light was different from the night. The fog had burned off, and the bay sparkled in the distance, and the campanile cast a long shadow across the plaza. Students walked past, talking, laughing, absorbed in their ordinary lives. None of them knew. None of them could know.

I went to my desk. I turned on the monitor. The analysis was still there—the beautiful, wrong output—exactly as I had left it.

For a moment, I considered deleting it. Just erasing the file, pretending it had never happened, going back to the world where Pattern 7 was a breakthrough and the future was full of possibility.

But I couldn't do that. The truth doesn't go away because you delete the evidence. I had seen something, and I couldn't unsee it.

So I did what scientists do. I documented. I wrote up the analysis, the cross-checks, the seventeen points of contradiction. I created a file called "P12_Validation_Failure.txt" and I put everything in it, every detail, every piece of evidence that my model was local.

Then I closed the file and I didn't look at it again for three weeks.

---

Those three weeks. I need to talk about those three weeks.

On the surface, nothing changed. I went to work. I came home. I ate dinner with Daniel, watched television with Daniel, slept beside Daniel. I attended meetings, responded to emails, maintained the appearance of a functioning researcher.

But underneath, everything was different. I was performing a role I no longer believed in. Every conversation about the project, every discussion of methodology, every optimistic email from Maya about our progress—all of it felt like theater. I nodded and agreed and said the expected things, and inside I was screaming.

Not literally screaming. The screaming was silent, which made it worse. It was the slack jaw extended into weeks, the inability to speak transformed into an inability to connect. I was there, but I wasn't there. Present in body, absent in everything else.

Daniel noticed. Of course he noticed—he knew me better than anyone. He asked if I was okay, if something was wrong, if I wanted to talk. I said I was fine, just stressed, just tired, just working through some difficult problems.

He accepted my answers because he loved me, and because love means trusting someone even when they're not telling the whole truth. He gave me space, gave me time, believed I would come to him when I was ready.

I never did. Not really. Not in the way he deserved.

---

The sun is setting. I've been writing for hours, and I'm still sitting in this garage, and I still haven't booked a flight.

My phone shows three missed calls from Ewa. One voicemail: "Tom, please call. She's asking for you. Please."

I know what I should do. I know what a good son would do. But I am not a good son—I have never been a good son—and the knowledge of my failure is not enough to change my behavior.

This is the thing about understanding. It doesn't automatically lead to action. You can see the truth clearly, see exactly what you need to do, and still not do it. The seeing and the doing are separate functions, and sometimes the gap between them is infinite.

---

Let me finish the chapter.

Three weeks after the night in the lab, I finally told someone. Not Daniel. Not my mother. Not any of the people who should have been first.

I told Yusuf.

He was working late, which was unusual for him. I walked past his desk on my way out and saw him hunched over a screen, frowning at something.

"Tom," he said, looking up. "You're here late."

"Always."

"You okay? You've seemed..." He paused, searching for the word. "Distant. Lately."

And something broke open. Not the whole truth—I couldn't manage the whole truth—but a piece of it. I sat down in the chair next to his desk and I said:

"I tested the model on Pattern 12. It doesn't work."

His face changed. Not dramatically—Yusuf was not a dramatic person—but I saw the shift. The concern, the calculation, the quick assessment of what this meant.

"Doesn't work how?"

I told him. The cross-checks, the contradictions, the beautiful wrong output. I kept my voice steady, clinical, the voice of a scientist describing a failed experiment. But my hands were shaking. My hands had been shaking for three weeks.

When I finished, Yusuf was quiet for a long time. Then he said:

"Have you told Maya?"

"No."

"Are you going to?"

I looked at him. I looked at this man I had worked beside for years, this careful thinker with his cautious questions.

"I don't know how," I said. "I don't know how to explain what it means."

He nodded slowly. And then he said something I've never forgotten:

"Maybe that's the point. Maybe you're not supposed to explain it. Maybe you're just supposed to show them, and let them draw their own conclusions."

It was good advice. Wise advice. The kind of advice that would have saved me months of anguish if I had taken it.

I didn't take it. I couldn't. The compulsion to explain was too strong, the need to make people understand too deep. I would spend the next year trying to find the right words, and the words would fail, and everything would fall apart.

But that comes later. For now, I sat in Yusuf's office and felt, for the first time since that night, that I was not completely alone.

---

I'm going to stop here. I'm going to close my laptop, and I'm going to pick up my phone, and I'm going to call Ewa.

I don't know what I'll say. I don't know how to explain why I haven't come, why I'm sitting in California writing about the past while my mother dies in Kraków. There are no good words for that.

But I'm going to call anyway. I'm going to speak into the silence, imperfectly, inadequately. I'm going to do what the slack jaw taught me: reach across the gap, knowing the gap can't be closed.

Maybe that's all any of us can do. Maybe that's what language is for—not to bridge distances but to acknowledge them. To say: *I am here, you are there, the space between us is real, and I am reaching toward you anyway.*

My mother is dying. The signals are singing. The fog is rolling in.

I pick up the phone.
